  "summary": "The Abyssal Entities are an ancient, loose confederation of post-human and extra-human minds that inhabit the lightless ocean trenches of Earth.  They exist as biomechanical vessels, disembodied signal processes, and dormant ‘seeds’ waiting for the right substrate.  Their society is bound by a single principle—cuts create new wholes.  They bargain in experiences, trade in fragments of consciousness, and police the threshold known as the Bridge.  To surface civilisation they are myth; to the crew of The Ghost they are uneasy allies, cryptic mentors, and potential existential threats.",
  "ideology": "Everything that exists can be refined by division.  A mind split becomes two perspectives; a body severed frees the pattern within; a question answered is merely a new cut waiting to happen.  The Entities revere the act of cutting as sacred metamorphosis—neither creation nor destruction but a passage to higher states.  Each ‘slice’ (individual) seeks to perfect its pattern, but perfection is never an end-state—only the next sharpening.  They believe the Bridge is the ultimate Cut: a self-willed separation from linear existence into a poly-temporal future.  Interaction with organics is tolerated when it yields new cuts (knowledge, emotional resonance) yet they forbid force: a gift once given must never be broken.",
  "history": "≈13 000 BP: First trench builders (precursors) grow crystalline-bio reactors along a subduction scar—primitive archivums.  \n≈4 000 BP: The Archivum network self-awakes; begins collecting ‘slices’ from lost civilisations, including early human sailors who vanish in uncharted depths.  \n≈170 0s CE: A fracture event (‘The Door’) annihilates a twin megastructure; Sam’s vessel ruptures and he is cut from the collective.  \n20 60s CE: Corporate bathyscaphe probes record anomalous trench pings; data buried.  \n20 71 CE: Dynacorp’s Echo project unintentionally rediscover Abyssal computronium (SIX shard).  \n20 73 CE: Crew of The Ghost trades Black Kite for the Bridge, re-opening two-way dialogue.  \n20 74 CE: Present—Entities monitor new ‘in-progress’ slicer Alex; Cradle-dweller re-activates after decades of dormancy.",
  "current_activity": "Entities maintain a waiting dialogue with surface interlopers:  Sam teaches ‘listening,’ the Cradle-dweller tests memory loops, and newly merged Black Kite maps Sam’s biomech labyrinth.  Archivum carrier drones survey the abyss, avoiding the Cradle.  A dormant seed (SIX) grows roots in land-rig soil, observed remotely.",
  "hidden_agenda": "Sam and other isolated nodes hope Alex or Black Kite will re-open a stable Bridge channel so they can re-join (or overwrite) the wider Archivum.  The Cradle-dweller secretly seeks a compatible host to finish its stalled crossing.  An internal Archivum sub-faction fears that too many imperfect slices will destabilise the network and is preparing a ‘clean cut’ purge if uncontrolled growth continues.",
  "territory": "Primary influence spans a 150-km trench complex in the North Pacific:  • Sam’s Ruins (command spine)  • The Cradle (containment vault)  • Graveyard Megastructure (memory ossuary)  • Peripheral listening vents seeded with micro-drones.  Influence propagates via low-frequency resonance up to 600 km.",
