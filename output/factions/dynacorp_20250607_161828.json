  "summary": "Dynacorp is the apex predator of the late-21st-century corporate ecology: a neuro-biotech, security and logistics behemoth whose helix-and-infinity sigil casts a literal shadow from Night City’s skyline to orbital data crosses.  Public-facing divisions sell neural-lace wearables and municipal drone policing; behind mirrored boardroom glass, Special-Projects chief Naomi Kurata is salvaging the reputational wreckage of Project Echo by any means necessary—silencing digital fugitives, absorbing Halcyon’s rogue research, and pushing the AURORA executive-immortality program that will hard-lock the board into eternal, loyalty-gated host bodies.  Wounded but furious after the Echo black-site disaster and Victor Sato’s disappearance, Dynacorp is in full consolidation mode—deploying VOX contractors, Recovery Division shock teams and Sentinel-Veil surveillance swarms while leveraging an off-world server network and a trillion-scrip war chest to ensure the future of consciousness remains a subscription tier they alone can sell.",
  "ideology": "Corporate Neomercantilism: every resource—physical, digital, neural or emotional—possesses a market value that can be measured, securitized and resold.  Human minds are the last untapped commodity, and Dynacorp intends to patent their after-lives.  Governance is obsolete; predictive analytics plus enforceable contracts equal stability.  Freedom exists only to the extent it increases overall corporate resilience.  The ideal future is a vertically integrated civilisation where birth, career, healthcare and post-mortem consciousness are subscription layers in a single, eternal service plan.",
  "history": "2054  – Dynamic Logistics Solutions emerges from post-Collapse salvage crews.\n2062-69 – Absorbs six biotech start-ups, patents the first consumer neural-lace and rebrands as Dynacorp.\n2074  – Forms ‘Halcyon Joint Venture’, publicly a research exchange, secretly a consciousness-transfer skunkworks.\n2079  – Project Echo authorised; Dr. Alina Voss becomes the first unwilling upload.\n2081  – Victor Sato forces daughter Emilia’s transfer; Echo touted as ethical immortality.\n2082  – Black-site Echo server destroyed; Alina’s weights stolen; Sato framed and vanishes; Board Purge begins.\n2083-present – Kurata ascends, rolls out Glass-Vault containment, contracts VOX Team, and secretly launches AURORA to enslave the board in loyalty-locked host bodies.",
  "current_activity": "Kurata is relocating Echo research into sealed ‘Glass Vault’ arcologies, tasking Recovery Division to recapture rogue uploads (Alina, Lansky, Emilia) while PR Integrity spins Echo as external sabotage.  VOX contractors shadow Nexus rumours, Sentinel-Veil analytics hunt for Bridge anomalies, and R&D pushes Echo-Gen III bioreactors for AURORA pilot hosts.  Simultaneously, consumer divisions launch neural-lace Wellness 4.0 to restore shareholder faith.",
  "hidden_agenda": "Kurata’s inner circle intends to roll out Project AURORA in six months, offering board members ‘eternal stewardship’ in loyalty-locked Echo-Gen III hosts.  Embedded JANUS killswitches will allow Kurata—or the AI ledger she is grooming—to terminate dissenting directors instantly.  Once AURORA is live, Dynacorp will pivot society to tiered, subscription-based immortality with Dynacorp as sole gatekeeper.",
