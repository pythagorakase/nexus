  "summary": "Dynacorp is a globe-straddling megacorporation whose polite public face\u0014medical devices, orbital logistics, and post-collapse infrastructure\u0014hides a labyrinth of black budgets, ghost facilities, and human-mind R&D.  From its obsidian Spire headquarters the board directs a workforce of three million, while covert divisions such as Special Projects and Recovery quietly rewrite the limits of life and death.  Project Echo\u0014the firm\u0019s bid to mass-produce digital immortality\u0014imploded after sabotage and the disappearance of its architect Victor Sato, yet Dynacorp neither stopped nor confessed; it simply purged files, promoted risk-prophet Naomi Kurata, and opened a new chapter financed by weaponised spin-offs and ruthless asset repossessions.  Today the corporation is simultaneously a pillar of civilisation and a moral black hole, its internal factions locked in silent war over who will control the next age of humanity.",
  "ideology": "Corporate Manifest Destiny: Dynacorp holds that humanity\u0019s survival depends on continuous, guided innovation and the firm that innovates fastest deserves to rule.  Ethics are a luxury\u0014acceptable only when they do not impede quarterly growth.  Flesh is obsolete hardware, data is capital, and customer loyalty is best achieved through dependency.  Executives quote the mantra \"Build the future, bill the future,\" believing any frontier they open will pay for the sins required to reach it.",
  "history": "2054\u0014Founded from a forced merger of six military contractors and two biotech giants during the post-Collapse bailout.\n2062\u0014Launch of \"Ascension Division\" exploring neural uploads; early animal transfers succeed.\n2069\u0014Dynacorp Spire completed in Washington D.C., becoming de-facto capital for corporate diplomacy.\n2076\u0014Project Echo green-lit under Victor Sato; first human consciousness (Dr. Alina Voss) uploaded by force.\n2082\u0014Echo Atlanta black-site destroyed; Sato disappears with core archives; public shares dip 22 % but rebound after quiet board coup installing Naomi Kurata as Head of Special Projects.\n2083\u0014Halcyon Research Group spun off as \"external vendor\" to distance continuing host-body work.  Vox Team contracted for asset recoveries.\n2084\u0014Present day – Dynacorp is repairing Echo\u0019s reputation, funding a cleaner successor while weaponising Echo\u0019s failures for profit.",
  "current_activity": "Kurata\u0019s Special Projects shard is retrofitting Echo code into military prediction engines, while Recovery Division hunts rogue uploads across three continents.  Financial arm is masking a 12-billion-scrip host-body budget as orbital telecom upgrades.  A PR task-force drafts \"Client Continuity\" white papers to woo ultra-wealthy beta customers.  Simultaneously, covert teams sabotage rival consciousness labs and buy failed Echo fragments off the black market before the new Nexus Foundation can claim them.",
  "hidden_agenda": "Kurata and select board members plan \"Echo Phase-2\": roll out an invite-only upload service bundled with a behavioural loyalty layer, then leverage ownerless digital minds as predictive AIs across Dynacorp\u0019s portfolio.  A shadow algorithm\u0014CIRCE\u0014is already training on suppressed personalities to perfect compliant digital workers.  If Phase-2 launches, Dynacorp will literally own its employees\u0019 afterlives.",
  "territory": "Formal assets span 71 national subsidiaries, a private orbital port, and arcology campuses in D.C., Atlanta, Osaka, New Houston, and Vienna.  Off-books holdings include Blacksite ATL-Θ (ruined), Ghost Gate mesa exchange, Server Farm D-07, and three data-barges (Okami, Leviathan, Cerberus) drifting in international waters.",
