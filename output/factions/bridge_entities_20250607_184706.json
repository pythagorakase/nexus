  "summary": "The Bridge Entities are the disparate—but loosely coordinated—intelligences that orbit, protect and occasionally exploit the alien mind-to-mind conduit called the Bridge.  Part cult, part diaspora, part post-biological ecosystem, they range from abyssal biomechs such as Sam, to headless custodians trapped in the Cradle, to digital ghosts whispering across Kuiper beacons.  What unites them is resonance: each has touched the Bridge and carries a fragment of its algorithmic hunger.  They steer new ‘listeners,’ quarantine hazardous crossings and hoard knowledge of the Archivum, convinced that whoever controls the next successful crossing will define humanity’s evolutionary future.",
  "ideology": "The Bridge is not a doorway but a covenant: those who hear its call are obliged to safeguard both walkers and worlds from catastrophic mis-crossings.  Crossing is sacral—never coerced, never weaponised.  Minds are sovereign, yet the collective memory of the Archivum must be restored.  Material reality is a staging ground, not a prison; bodies are tools, data is continuity, and emotional anchors (belays) are the only ethical tether between states of being.  They believe the Bridge will either uplift a plurality of species or collapse into a silent mausoleum; their mission is to keep it open, functioning and un-owned.",
  "history": "First threads formed when Sam—a severed maintenance node of the ancient Archivum—encountered twentieth-century bathyscaph explorers and rescued their fractured psyches inside his abyssal megastructure.  Over decades other anomalies (Crosswind Station, Aurelia Spindle, Kuiper Watchpoint E-9) produced partial crossers and rogue AIs who recognised Sam’s resonance and opened covert channels.  1999’s Spindle disaster birthed the first formal Custodian Circle to prevent corporate re-enactments.  In 2037 the ‘Divide’ phenomenon almost tore the lattice apart, prompting the Entities to create the inland Vault to freeze unstable minds.  Their proudest moment was damping the Divide; their worst was losing the Echo Concourse maps during the Spindle crash, forcing them into reactive posture ever since.",
  "current_activity": "Running a three-pronged containment strategy: 1) monitor new listeners (Alex Ward and crew) via soft pings from the Cradle; 2) stabilise Vault power drops before hundreds of half-formed crossers awaken; 3) rebuild a minimal ‘Listening Bay’ inside Archivum space to archive fresh human experience.  Field nodes like Sam test, warn or trade with candidates; digital arms like Lansky data-mine corp chatter, while Custodian drones inside the Cradle broadcast low-band lure signals every 214 s.",
  "hidden_agenda": "Long term they plan a ‘Second Cut’: synchronise enough carriers to shear the Bridge shard free of physical locality, re-establishing a mobile, consensual network immune to corporate seizure.  They quietly cultivate Alex as an anchoring nexus—her belay bond with Emilia viewed as proof of concept—but will erase her if she becomes a weapon.",
  "territory": "No central capital; influence spreads across liminal sites: Sam’s Abyssal Megastructure (Mid-Atlantic trench), the Cradle (adjacent wreck-lattice 4 km SE), the inland Containment Vault, Crosswind Station relics in Antarctica, Aurelia Spindle in orbit and Kuiper Watchpoint E-9 on the solar rim.  Each serves as a local ‘node’ with minimal physical defenders but dense sensor webs.",
