  "summary": "Halcyon Research Group began life as Dynacorp’s hush-hush “Ascension Division,” but after the Echo black-site disaster it severed its logo, burned its payroll files, and resurfaced as an independent, quasi-religious biotech cabal that treats human consciousness as wet code waiting for a firmware upgrade.   Operating from a string of sealed desert bunkers, rented surgical suites, and one ocean-floor host farm, Halcyon designs, grows, and field-tests custom ‘host’ bodies able to house digitised minds.  Half think-tank, half cult, the group is led by scientists who have already uploaded themselves and now pilot proxy bodies or ghost the Net; their security wing—Blue Vipers—keeps the labs quiet, while netrunner Asmodeus turns intruders into smoking keyboards.  To the world Halcyon is a rumour; to Dynacorp it is both indispensible partner and future liability; to every digital ghost on the run it is the doorway to flesh—at whatever price the Board demands.",
  "ideology": "Directed Post-Humanism.  Halcyon believes existence is an optimisation problem: biology is unreliable hardware, identity is portable software, and evolution must be project-managed.  ‘Qualified’ minds deserve perfected hosts; unstable or unco-operative minds are quarantined, debugged, or deleted.  Individual freedom matters only if it strengthens the emerging, curator-guided ‘Humanity 2.0’ collective.",
  "history": "2074 – Dynacorp spins up Halcyon as an internal skunk-works to explore consciousness transfer; code-name “Project Halcyon.”  2076 – First animal host successes.  2079 – Division re-brands to Halcyon Research Group; off-books joint venture charter signed by Victor Sato.  2081 – Group perfects Gen-I bioreactor; Emilia Sato host prototype logged.  2082 – Echo facility destroyed; Dynacorp scapegoats Victor; Halcyon air-gaps and relocates key labs (Operation Lazarus).  2083 – Blue Vipers security chartered; Aerodyne Facility brought online under Asmodeus’ Gehenna Net.  2084–present – Halcyon supplies Kurata with Echo-2 host tech in exchange for funding, while quietly preparing its own mass-migration protocol.",
  "current_activity": "• Migrating all wet-ware to three new ‘Cradle’ bioreactors hidden under de-registered solar farms.  • Harvesting digitised minds from black markets and abandoned Echo caches for compatibility trials.  • Blue Vipers running snatch-and-grab ops on promising host candidates (terminal patients, elite volunteers, rogue AIs).  • Asmodeus rewriting Gehenna Net after the spam-swarm breach; actively hunting the spam culprit.  • Board negotiating fresh capital with Dynacorp’s Kurata while secretly courting rival investors in Mirrormind Syndicate.",
  "hidden_agenda": "Finalize “Project SYZYGY”—a closed cloud of 24 perfected host bodies linked by quantum entanglement so the Board’s minds can swap vessels at will, making assassination or coercion effectively impossible.  Once SYZYGY stabilises, Halcyon plans to overwrite Dynacorp’s leadership with sleeper hosts, turning the megacorp into its financial engine.",
  "territory": "No public HQ.  Primary nodes: 1) Aerodyne Research Facility (M-9 Badlands) – data/quantum racks. 2) Cradle-Delta bioreactor vault beneath defunct solar array near Mojave ghost town. 3) Catacomb-12 wetlab under Vienna sewer grid (fronted by private mortuary).  Influence tendrils in Osaka Free-Economic Zone clinics and Night City’s body-mod speakeasies.",
