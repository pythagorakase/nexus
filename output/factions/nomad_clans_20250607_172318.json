  "summary": "The Nomad Clans are a loose but fiercely inter-woven network of drifting families, biker packs, merchant caravans and roadside artisans who have turned the Badlands’ cracked highways into a roving, self-governed nation. Ringing their nightly circle-fires with rust-patched rigs and neon scrap, they move freight the corps can’t trace, heal fugitives in solar-scarred clinics, and keep the lifeblood of salvage, fuel and gossip flowing between isolated outposts. Equal parts travelling bazaar, mobile militia and cultural commons, the Clans command the open road through cooperation rather than conquest: every member—from chrome-peddling charmers like Smiley to matriarch engineers such as Red Wren—knows that freedom only survives if the convoy keeps rolling and every wheel in the circle pulls its weight.",
  "ideology": "Doctrine of the Open Road: movement is life, freedom is sacred, and mutual aid is the price of that freedom. Clan law insists on the Circle Oath—“no deal, no steal”—and on Road Sovereignty, the belief that any surface unguarded by walls or corporate deeds belongs to those who keep it passable. Technology is a tool to stay unchained, not a master; biotech, cyberware and even nuclear tech are accepted so long as they serve mobility and community. Corporate structures are distrusted not for their tech, but for their hierarchies, which the Clans consider cages.",
  "history": "Born in the chaos after the Southern Water Riots and the Corporate Partition, the first caravans—Dust Tide, Red Sky and Bone Runners—merged for protection at the so-called Circle of Ash, a burned-out weigh station where they vowed to keep engines running together. The Galveston Dust-Storm Massacre (when a corporate security team shelled a medical convoy) forged their ‘treat all, judge none’ medical creed and led to the founding of the Nomad MedTechs. A Militech gunship strike five years ago nearly wiped out the travelling Bazaar; the convoy survived by collapsing market stalls into escape pods in under twenty minutes, cementing the now-legendary pack-up doctrine. Since then the Clans have expanded, linking mechanic outposts, hidden water farms and desert data tombs into a rolling republic.",
  "current_activity": "• Re-armouring the Bazaar for an upcoming run through the Glass Dunes drone corridor.\n• Negotiating with off-grid AIs for bandwidth in exchange for salvage data.\n• Escorting a hush-hush micro-reactor shipment (payment for the Mothership crew’s new research pod).\n• Mediating a simmering feud over a stolen hydrogen cracker at the central camp.",
  "hidden_agenda": "The Steering Circle quietly stockpiles reactor cores and high-grade alloys to build ‘Skyline’, a modular sky-rig meant to break even airborne corporate blockades—turning the nomads into a three-dimensional trade empire.",
  "territory": "No fixed borders, but strong presence along Ordnance Corridor M-7, the Milebreaker Bypass bazaar route, and the tri-camp triangle formed by Nomad Camp, the Mechanic Outpost and the rolling Nomad Bazaar. Satellite clans patrol fuel-rich salt flats and the deep-desert rail spurs.",
  "power_level": 0.65,
