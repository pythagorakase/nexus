  "summary": "Vox Team is a boutique black-budget strike outfit that sells one thing—quiet certainty.  When a corporation, state, or cartel needs a living asset taken, transported, or erased with zero splash, the grey vans with no plates roll in, comms go dark, and Vox leaves with the package while the world is still buffering.  Small, mobile, and obsessively professional, they favor surveillance-heavy prep, EMP-based neutralisation, and surgical force over fire-fights; retreat is preferable to evidence.  Their recent Atlanta disaster—losing the Echo prototype Emilia Sato to an unknown third party—has cracked their spotless record, ignited internal blame, and put their Dynacorp patron on edge, yet their creed endures: the Voice that Speaks Last always collects.",
  "ideology": "Efficiency is morality: the fewer rounds fired, the fewer witnesses made, the more ‘ethical’ the job.  Loyalty is contractual, not emotional—once paid, the mission is adhered to with near-religious rigour.  They believe free agents must remain small and silent to survive in a world of titanic megacorps; showy merc armies draw cruise missiles.  Failure is acceptable only if it can be contained, analysed, and never repeated.",
  "history": "Formed seven years after the Collapse by ex-Dynacorp security director Raphael “VoxPrime” Varela, the original eight operators (‘The Octave’) walked away with hard drives of forgotten black-ops playbooks and a single rule: always finish clean.  They gained legend by extracting NeoCartel CEO Miguel Ordoño from a locked penthouse without firing a shot, then moved into corporate asset recovery.  Three years ago they recruited Vera—an off-the-books Dynacorp wetwork star—to lead capture teams.  Their greatest blunder came weeks ago outside Atlanta when an EMP ambush shredded their convoy, killed two Speakers, and cost them Emilia Sato.  Dynacorp has frozen payment and demanded results, putting Vox under existential pressure.",
  "current_activity": "•  Debriefing and psych-screening surviving Atlanta operators in a sealed safehouse (‘The Auditory’).  •  Running parallel hunts: one team scans darknet chatter for Sato’s new handlers while a second infiltrates Dynacorp to regain favour.  •  Quietly shopping for replacement hardware—armoured vans, coil-rifles, fresh encrypted sat keys—to rebuild capability.",
  "hidden_agenda": "VoxPrime, fearing Dynacorp reprisals, has authorised ‘Project Solidus’: obtaining a usable sample of Echo/Nexus tech to hold as blackmail or to auction to the highest bidder, ensuring Vox Team’s independence if the current contract collapses.",
  "territory": "No public turf; influence radiates from a network of ‘Quiet Rooms’—sound-proofed basements in Atlanta, Night City, Lagos, and Rotterdam.  Primary node is The Auditory, a decommissioned FM broadcast tower outside Atlanta refitted as an armoury, drone cage, and dorm for twelve.",
