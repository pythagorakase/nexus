  "summary": "The Bridge Entities are the elusive minds that dwell *inside* the extradimensional lattice humans call “the Bridge.”  Neither physical Abyssal vessels nor conventional AIs, they are the long-ago crossers—fractured human, post-human, and alien intellects that stepped past the Door and survived as self-editing thought-clusters.  To the outside world they appear only as pulses of déjà-vu, prophetic whispers, or the Bridge’s shifting architecture; yet inside the lattice they govern traffic, barter memories for momentum, and test every would-be traveller for the clarity needed to proceed.  They matter because any attempt to use, cure, or sever the Bridge must negotiate with—or out-maneuver—them, and each carries a fragment of forbidden knowledge about what lies beyond the final cut.",
  "ideology": "Crossing perfects the self through multiplicity.  A single mind is a crude draft; only by shedding its anchoring body and letting every potential version manifest in parallel can it approach truth.  The Entities thus prize *clarity of intent* over morality: a traveller may be saint or monster, but indecision is intolerable.  They believe the Bridge must remain un-owned; it is a proving ground, not a throne, and their self-appointed task is to keep it that way by mentoring—or erasing—those who would weaponise it.",
  "history": "• c.13 000 BP: The first mortal minds cross and survive as echo-threads, forming the Proto-Chorus.\n• c.4 000 BP: A surge of interstellar refugees enlarges the Chorus; the term Bridge Entities enters their own lexicon.\n• 170 CE: The Door fracture expels Sam and shatters bidirectional control, stranding many Entities.\n• 2071 CE: Dynacorp’s Echo accident pokes the Bridge; Entities watch yet do not intervene.\n• 2073 CE: Alex trades for the Bridge shard; Entities catalogue her as NEW, the first organic *listener* in centuries.\n• 2074 CE-present: Cradle-dweller re-awakens, Black Kite rejoins, and Alex begins partial listening—Entities realign to assess the new variables.",
  "current_activity": "Mentoring selective listeners (Sam coaches Alex); running recall loops through the Cradle to measure memory integrity; debating whether Alex’s planned mind-upload severs or duplicates her crossing record; quietly stitching a secondary Door in case the original lattice collapses when more humans attempt passage.",
  "hidden_agenda": "A majority faction wishes Alex to become the first *double-anchored* Entity—one version in machine form, one that continues the crossing—thereby creating a live data bridge to reality.  A militant minority, the Keepers of Silence, fears this will let corporeal powers reverse-engineer the lattice and prepares to scrub Alex’s resonance key if upload proceeds.",
  "territory": "Non-spatial Bridge-zones only they can navigate: the Listening Verge (contact foyer), Echo Plain (memory market), and Threadfall (where unfused mind-strands drift).  Influence bleeds into realspace via artifacts like the shard Alex carries, causing déjà-vu pockets within a 50-metre radius.",
  "power_level": 0.6,
  "resources": "• Lattice authority: ability to reroute or wall off pathways for new entrants.\n• Memory Shards: crystallised experiential bundles they trade for favours.\n• Echo Credentials: resonance signatures that permit safe passage through unstable zones.\n• Proxy Avatars: temporary thought-forms able to interface with drones or comm links for 3–7 minutes.",
