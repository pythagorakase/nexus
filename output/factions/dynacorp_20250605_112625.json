  "summary": "Dynacorp is the world’s most feared and admired megacorporation—an omnipresent neuro-biotech, security and logistics titan whose skyscraper spires shadow half the globe.  Publicly it promises progress, connectivity and employment; privately it treats every mind, market and micron of data as a fungible asset.  Reeling from the disastrous exposure of Project Echo, Dynacorp has entered a ruthless consolidation phase under new Special-Projects chief Naomi Kurata.  The company is simultaneously hunting rogue digital fugitives, covering up shadow mass-graves of broken uploads, and quietly prototyping the next generation of loyalty-locked “Echo-2” hosts.  With trillions in capital, a black-budget military the size of a small nation and servers orbiting three different planets, Dynacorp remains an apex predator—wounded, furious, and determined to own the future of human consciousness.",
  "ideology": "Corporate Neomercantilism: all value is measurable, therefore tradable.  Dynacorp believes the human mind is simply the last great natural resource—once digitised it can be copied, improved and monetised indefinitely.  Governments are obsolete relics; stability comes from predictive analytics and enforceable contracts, not elections.  Individuals have freedom only insofar as they increase overall corporate resilience.  The future Dynacorp envisions is a vertically integrated civilisation where birth, career, healthcare and after-life are subscription tiers in a single, eternal service plan.",
  "history": "2054: Founded as Dynamic Logistics Solutions, a post-Collapse salvage outfit that bought war-zone ruins for pennies and resold the metals. 2062-2069: Absorbed half a dozen biotech start-ups, rebranded to Dynacorp and patented the first consumer neural-lace. 2074: Launched HALCYON joint venture (publicly a research exchange, secretly a consciousness-transfer skunkworks). 2079: Project Echo green-lit; first unwilling upload (Dr. Alina Voss) proves technical viability. 2081: Victor Sato forces upload of daughter Emilia; Echo’s “success” pitched to board. 2082: EXEC-DELTA-17 sabotage destroys primary blacksite, Sato framed and vanishes; Echo data heisted, servers slagged. 2083-Present: Naomi Kurata seizes Special-Projects, initiates Board Purge, contracts VOX Team for asset recovery, activates JANUS kill-switches on runaway hosts.",
  "current_activity": "Kurata is migrating all Echo research to isolated ‘glass vaults’, issuing province-wide gag orders, and leaning on Halcyon to deliver a controllable Echo-2 prototype.  Recovery Division operatives and VOX contractors hunt rogue subjects (Emilia, Alina, Lansky) while PR teams spin Echo as industrial sabotage.  Parallel divisions push consumer wearables, municipal drone policing contracts and off-world resource monopolies to keep shareholder confidence high.",
  "hidden_agenda": "Kurata’s inner circle is secretly preparing ‘Project AURORA’, an executive-only immortality pilot that will silence board dissent by promising select directors digital resurrection—provided they sign over irrevocable voting rights first.  Successful roll-out would give Kurata de facto dictatorial control of Dynacorp.  AURORA research combines Halcyon’s host tech with leaked Nexus rumours, and includes a buried subroutine that hard-locks executive personalities to a loyalty framework.",
  "territory": "Corporate arcologies in Night City (Dynacorp Spire), New Houston, and the Osaka Free-Economic Zone; deep-sea data barges (Okami, Leviathan), and three orbital ‘Data Cross’ relays.  Blacksite network spans Atlanta (now compromised), Atlanta-North Ridge Reserve, and Pacific Maglev Line Site Theta.  Nomad exclusion zones are treated as informal buffer regions patrolled by Recovery Division drones.",
  "power_level": 0.93,
  "resources": "Annual revenue north of 7.1 trn scrip; black-budget war chest ~180 bn.  Private army (Recovery Division), VOX spec-ops contractors, Sentinel Veil surveillance mesh, orbital servers, swarm drones, gene-print fabs, exclusive licensing on Halcyon host bioreactors.  Political influence in five megacities, majority stake in three news syndicates, covert equity in Mirrormind concierge AI.",
