  "summary": "Dynacorp is the East-Coast megacorp that quietly owns half the post-Collapse eastern seaboard: a vertically-integrated behemoth whose arcologies, data-mines and biotech foundries keep the lights on for millions while its Black-Budget Special Projects division rewrites the definition of life itself.  From consumer neuro-toys to orbital supply chains, Dynacorp’s public face is innovation and stability; behind the mirrored spires, ruthless board jockeys weaponise mind-upload tech, buy private armies like Vox Team, and burn whole labs to ash when a secret goes sour.  After the catastrophic failure of Project Echo—and the disappearance of VP Victor Sato—the company teeters between reform, cover-up and a shadow war with its one-time partner Halcyon, yet the Board remains united on one point: whatever replaces Echo must be theirs first, no matter how many ghosts litter the servers.",
  "ideology": "Corporate Neo-Utilitarianism: progress is measured in quarterly returns and population-scale problem solving. Every invention, policy and life is judged by its contribution to Dynacorp’s bottom line and to the corporation-as-polity. ‘Good’ is whatever keeps the grid humming; morals that obstruct efficiency are bugs to be patched.  When technology promises immortality, it is *irresponsible* not to monetise it—and safer to own every soul before a rival does.",
  "history": "2056 – Formed from the forced merger of nine tech-energy conglomerates under UN Reconstruction Charter.\n2064 – Launch of Presence-Marker security lattice, making Dynacorp campuses quasi-sovereign territory.\n2069 – Ascension Division (later *Halcyon*) green-lit to explore human digitisation.\n2074 – Project Echo moves from animal uploads to illicit human trials; Sato promoted to VP Neuro-Biotech.\n2082 – Echo black-site in Atlanta destroyed by internal sabotage; Dynacorp blames Sato, freezes assets.\n2083 – Naomi Kurata, Risk Containment prodigy, assumes Special Projects portfolio, begins Echo-2.\n2084 – Present: Board fights three-front damage-control war (Halcyon split, Vox Team failure, whistle-blower leaks) while quietly draining regional pension funds to keep R&D running.",
  "current_activity": "Kurata’s task-force is migrating Echo-2 core code into quantum shards under the Arcology Spire; Recovery Division is sweeping black markets for stray Echo subjects; Internal Audit hunting for Sato, Cross and any data that ties the Board to illegal uploads; Marketing rolls out ‘Nexus-lite’ neuroware to reacquire public trust; Logistics diverts stealth convoys to new desert host farms.",
  "hidden_agenda": "Project JANUS: the Board orders Kurata to perfect a dual-stack host—one layer public-facing ‘voluntary immortality’ to capture market share, the second an encrypted loyalty kernel granting Dynacorp silent remote influence over every uploaded executive and government client.",
  "territory": "Headquarters arcology in Night City’s eastern finance ring; satellite campuses in New Houston, New York-Delta, Osaka Free-Economic Zone.
