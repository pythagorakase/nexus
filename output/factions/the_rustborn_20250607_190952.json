  "summary": "The Rustborn are a roving, scrap-armoured convoy-nation that thunders across the Badlands in a wall of rust-red haulers, jury-rigged tanks and hover-barges, preaching iron-forged freedom and striking any corporation foolish enough to venture beyond the neon glow of Night City. Led by the charismatic war-tactician Juno “Dynacorp’s Bane,” they weld scavenger clans into a mobile city called Rusthaven, hiding state-of-the-art jammers and EMP artillery beneath layers of salvaged steel. Equal parts guerrilla army, desert trade union and folk-hero militia, the Rustborn protect nomad routes, redistribute captured corporate cargo to wasteland settlements, and dream of a world where no wall, patent or ID chip can chain a human soul.",
  "ideology": "Creed of the Unchained Road: movement is sovereignty, rust is honesty and every corporate logo is a brand of slavery. The Rustborn believe freedom cannot outlive stagnation—anything that stops rolling (settlements, contracts, even grudges) will corrode and become a tyrant. Technology is welcomed only if it can be repaired with desert scrap and shared without licenses. Vengeance against Dynacorp is not mere revenge but reparations for every buried worker, every orphaned nomad and every stolen future.",
  "history": "The Rustborn trace their genesis to Dynacorp lithium Site 7B, where a cost-cutting “venting accident” suffocated half the workforce. Ten-year-old Juniper Reyes escaped with a clutch of orphans, stripping survey drones for water filters and vowing corporate blood-debt. Over two decades she welded feral scrap-gangs and refugee caravans into a single rolling column. Key moments include the Ash Run (stealing a fuel train to keep the convoy alive in 2068), the Mag-Lev Neuromat Heist that earned Juno her moniker, and the exile of the Sand Vipers biker cult after a mutiny over civilian collateral. Each victory grew the legend; each defeat added another layer of iron to their rigs.",
  "current_activity": "A 37-rig Rustborn column is idling at the Glass Flats, plotting an ambush on a hush-hush Dynacorp convoy carrying quantum decrypt rigs while scouts vet Alex Ward’s discreet request for sanctuary near Silo Pete. Tech-smiths patch armor plates, Stormcaller crews calibrate EMP shells, and Juno negotiates fuel swaps with Wraith’s smugglers over crackling shortwave.",
  "hidden_agenda": "Juno’s inner circle is covertly assembling ‘Project Rustveil’—a continent-spanning Dustnet upgrade that will bend desert mirages around the entire convoy, masking thermal signatures from orbital sensors. To power it, they must seize those quantum decrypt rigs and repurpose their Q-cores into cloak beacons—turning Rusthaven into a ghost city that can appear anywhere overnight.",
  "territory": "No fixed borders; influence radiates along the Ironbelt Trade Spine from the ruins of Site 7B to Night City’s southeast fringe. Semi-permanent footholds include the Rusthaven mega-rig, the Scorch-Track test range, hidden ammo caches beneath the Copper Dunes and a water-well triad at Gila Wells.",
