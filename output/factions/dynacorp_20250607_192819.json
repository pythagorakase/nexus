  "summary": "Dynacorp is a trans-continental mega-conglomerate whose polished glass towers hide a machinery of weaponised innovation, black-budget neurosurgery and quiet colonialism; it sells energy grids, security platforms and pharma miracles by day, while night-shift divisions traffic in predictive war-algorithms and the ownership of digitised souls. Ruthlessly pragmatic, publicly benevolent and privately terrified of falling behind, the corporation treats consciousness itself as the next harvestable commodity—and will bankrupt cities or erase employees to stay first in line.",
  "ideology": "Profit is proof of destiny. Dynacorp believes that markets are the most accurate expression of evolutionary pressure, and any technology that can be monetised must be domesticated—no matter its ethical cost. Human identity is simply high-value IP; immortality, mind-copying and behavioural rewrites are natural extensions of non-voluntary labour contracts. The corporation preaches meritocracy but practises managed scarcity: only shareholders deserve freedom, everyone else rents their future from the brand.",
  "history": "Founded in 2053 during the post-Collapse resource rush, Dynacorp began as a defence-energy consortium, won its first fortune bulking up Pacific security grids, then pivoted into neural biotech after buying out Halcyon’s debt-crushed R&D wing. 2069–2073 saw the golden years: Spiral Loop predictive AI, the Sentinel Veil surveillance mesh and, finally, Project Echo—full-stack mind-uploading under Executive Victor Sato. Echo’s Atlanta catastrophe, Emilia Sato’s abduction and the later server-vault heist ruptured internal trust; Sato vanished, Dr. Nyati defected, and Risk-Containment director Naomi Kurata executed a boardroom coup. She folded Echo into Special Projects and began culling every trace of the old regime.",
  "current_activity": "Kurata’s Dynacorp is in aggressive damage-control: migrating surviving Echo assets into a Phase-2 host programme, paying Specter Dynamics to reclaim rogue uploads, framing Sato for an external sabotage, and courting governments with Sentinel Veil v3 licences. PR fronts push regenerative medicine while VOX Team trails the Nexus fugitives; in parallel, Special Projects seeds ‘Phoenix Nodes’—pop-up wet-ware labs that can synthesise a host body in 96 hours.",
  "hidden_agenda": "Special Projects is embedding sub-threshold loyalty scripts (JANUS keys) into every Phase-2 brain lattice; once 1 000 compliant hosts exist, Dynacorp will launch ‘Continuity Bonds’—digital indenture contracts that keep vital executives alive and loyal even after physical death. Kurata also intends to erase or re-enslave every free digital mind, fearing a legal precedent for autonomy.",
  "territory": "Corporate HQ: Dynacorp Spire, Washington-NeoDC, levels 60–110.  R&D Core: subterranean server farm beneath campus (EchoCore Nexus).  Regional Blacksites: ATL-Θ (Atlanta), Ghost Gate mesa (Nevada badlands), Okami data barge (Sargasso ghost lanes).  Sentinel Veil nodes in most major US arcologies; logistics hubs in New Houston, Osaka Freezone and Night City’s industrial belt.",
  "power_level": 0.93,
  "resources": "Annual revenue 1.2 trillion scrip; sovereign-grade quantum fabs; private orbital launch pad; VOX Team (50 operatives), Specter Dynamics (500 contractors), ARGUS-Prime AI security grid, fleet of 27 stealth VTOLs, 3 autonomous data barges. Income streams: energy grids, defence contracts, biotech IP licensing, covert data-brokerage. Supply chain covertly moves clone nutrients, neural gel and restricted AI accelerators through shell companies.",
