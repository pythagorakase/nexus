# *NEXUS: Narrative Intelligence System*

# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose & Vision
We are building an intelligent, dynamic memory storage and retrieval system to augment AI-driven interactive/emergent storytelling. Apex-tier LLMs are capable of nuanced, elevated prose, but are limited by two critical weaknesses.
1. Inability to maintain continuity when length of narrative exceeds context window
2. Poor ability to plan for, or attend to, elements of the story that are not explicitly on screen:
	- activities of off-screen characters
	- changing states of other locations
	- internal states of characters (secrets, hidden agendas, etc.)

Our project aims to compensate for these weaknesses with a local-LLM-driven orchestration system that coordinates specialized utilities to:
1. Critically analyze new input from user & storyteller AI.
2. Dynamically and intelligently build an API payload to the apex-LLM that combines recent raw narrative, structured summaries of relevant character history and events, and excerpts from the historical narrative corpus curated for maximum relevance.
3. Incorporate the apex-LLMs response (newly-generated narrative + updates to hidden variables).

## 1.2 Scope & Limitations

### Limited Design "Team"
This is currently a passion project, driven by the user's desire to enjoy roleplaying and interactive storytelling with an AI beyond the constraints noted above. The development team is the user; you, the AI; and as many other AI instances as need be mustered by the user to see this project through, in whatever role is required: coding AI, project manager AI, debugging AI, etc. 

The user has limited somewhat technical knowledge, but is learning Python and SQL in order to better understand and guide the project.

### Vibe over Mechanics
The interactive, user-choice-driven flow has much in common with the kind of collaborative storytelling that can be found in tabletop RPG sessions with creative-minded people. However, incorporating similar rules systems is not currently a goal. When the user decides their character will attempt a difficult action, the result will be determined not by a "skill check" but rather by whatever the Apex AI determines is the best fit for the narrative. Similarly, there is no plan to design a "combat system".

There are already numerous rogue-like dungeon-crawlers with satisfyingly deep rules systems and tactics; instead of spending time and tokens trying to emulate them, our prime objective is to achieve unparalleled excellence in the roleplaying experience: richness of plot, depth of characters, a world that feels alive and engaging, and high-quality prose.

### Slow by Design
Real-time functionality is neither needed nor desired. The system is intentionally and strictly turn-based. In accordance with the overriding emphasis on quality latency is not just acceptable—it is expected.

## 1.3 Key Concepts
- **Apex AI**: Frontier LLM (Claude/GPT/Grok) that generates narrative content
- **Memory Tiers**: The three-part memory architecture (Strategic, Entity, Narrative)
- **Warm Slice**: Most recent narrative chunks plus new user input
- **Cold Distillation**: The process of retrieving and filtering narrative memory
- **Context Payload**: The assembled package of information sent to the Apex AI
- **Turn Cycle**: The step-by-step sequence from user input to new narrative
- **Entity State**: Character emotions, location conditions, faction status, etc.
- **Chunk**: A discrete piece of narrative text, typically a single scene or interaction

# 2. System Architecture

## 2.1 Architectural Overview
NEXUS is built on a single-agent orchestration architecture that extends the Letta framework. At its core, the system uses LORE as the primary intelligent agent that coordinates specialized utility modules in a turn-based cycle.

### Auxiliary Modules

#### `letta/agent.py` = `BaseAgent`
Base class defining the agent protocol, standard message format, and common utilities for the LORE agent.

#### `narrative_learner.py` Learning Engine
For future implementation. Would allow for user feedback to train LLMs for better contextual retrievals.

## 2.3 Letta Framework Integration
This system uses as a foundation the open-source Letta project (formerly known as MemGPT), a framework for building "stateful" agents with long-term memory. Letta is maintained as a **submodule** to preserve the distinction between the open source foundation and our custom code. This conserves the option of someday commercializing the project.

The framework is extended with LORE as the primary agent and a series of utility modules responsible for different aspects of the narrative preparation, generation, and processing pipeline.


## 2.4 Technical Dependencies

### Software
- **PostgreSQL with pgvector**: Powers the vectorized database for semantic search and embedding storage
- **SQLAlchemy**: Object-relational mapper for database interaction and query building
- **Alembic**: Database migration tool for versioning and evolving the database schema
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management library
- **Sentence-Transformers**: Powers the triple-embedding strategy using models like BGE and E5
- **Transformers**: Hugging Face's transformers library for accessing and using embedding models
- **pgvector**: PostgreSQL extension enabling vector similarity operations for semantic search
- **OpenAI API**: Interface for new narrative generation with frontier LLMs
- **Anthropic API**: Alternative interface for narrative generation with Claude models
- **FastAPI and Uvicorn**: Web framework and ASGI server for potential API endpoints

Development Hardware:
	- **Model**: MacBook Pro M4 Max
	- **CPU**: 16-core
		- 12 performance cores
		- 4 efficiency cores
	- **GPU**: 40-core
	- **Neural Engine**: 16-core
	- **Unified Memory**: 128GB
	- **Memory Bandwidth**: 546GB/s
	- **Storage**: 2TB SSD

# 3. Data Design

## 3.1 Memory Architecture
1. **Strategic Memory** (high-level narrative understanding):
    - Implemented as structured tables with explicit schemas
    - Accessed through direct SQL queries
    - Contains synthesized information about plot, themes, character arcs
2. **Entity Memory** (character/location tracking):
    - Implemented as structured tables with relationships
    - Accessed through entity-specific queries
    - Contains detailed state information for characters, locations, etc.
3. **Narrative Memory** (detailed text chunks):
    - Implemented as vector-enabled tables
    - Accessed through similarity search
    - Contains the actual narrative text with rich metadata

## 3.2 Database Schema
See `NEXUS_schema.sql`

## 3.3 Embedding Strategy

### Semantic Embedding
Models:
	- inf-retriever-v1-1.5b (1536 dimensions, weight 0.5)
	- E5-Large-V2 (1024 dimensions, weight 0.3)
	- BGE-Large-EN (1024 dimensions, weight 0.2)

#### Database Storage Strategy
The system uses separate tables for different vector dimensions:
- **chunk_embeddings_1536d**: Table for 1536-dimensional vectors (inf-retriever-v1-1.5b)
- **chunk_embeddings_1024d**: Table for 1024-dimensional vectors (E5-Large-V2, BGE-Large-EN)

This separation maintains efficient storage and query performance in PostgreSQL with pgvector, which requires fixed dimensions at table creation time.

#### Automatic Table Selection
The system includes utilities that automatically route queries to the correct table based on the model name, allowing for transparent usage of multiple vector dimensions in the same codebase.

#### Search Capabilities
1. **Semantic Understanding**: Converting narrative text into high-dimensional vector representations that capture meaning
2. **Similarity Calculation**: Determining semantic relatedness between queries and stored narrative chunks
3. **Multi-faceted Retrieval**: Supporting different types of information needs (factual, thematic, character-focused)
4. **Triple-Embedding Strategy**: Using multiple models to capture different semantic aspects
5. **Domain Adaptation**: Understanding narrative-specific terminology and concepts
6. **Hybrid Search Support**: Integrating with keyword and metadata-based search for comprehensive retrieval
7. **Cross-Encoder Reranking**: Using Naver TREC-DL22 model for final result refinement

See the detailed documentation in [docs/vector_embeddings.md](docs/vector_embeddings.md) for more information.

### Metadata Tagging
See:
`narrative_metadata_schema_2.json`
and
`batch_metadata_processing.py`

## 3.4 Cross-Reference System
- Entity-to-Narrative
	- character profile --> every scene where they appear
	- location --> descriptions and local events
	- objects/items --> passages where used or mentioned
- Entity Relationships
	- character <--> character
	- character <--> location
	- faction <--> territory
- Temporal Cross-References
	- story clock --> events occurring then
	- narrative order --> place in story progression
	- character timeline = person-specific chronology
- Thematic Links
	- themes (e.g., "transhumanism") --> scenes exploring this theme
	- motifs --> each appearance of motif
	- emotional tones --> passages with specific moods

## 4.2 Context Assembly Process
1. `LORE` dynamically calculates a context budget based on Apex AI TPM limits, assigning percentage shares for warm slice, historical passage quotes, and structured information.
2. `LORE` calls `PSYCHE` utility to formulate queries for most pertinent characters, relationships, and events.
3. `LORE` uses `MEMNON` utility to retrieve broad pool of candidate chunks using multi-model embeddings, with intermediate filtering and cross-encoder reranking for final selections.

## 4.3 Query Framework
The Query Framework serves as the communication backbone of NEXUS, enabling structured information exchange between LORE and its utility modules. It extends Letta's existing query capabilities with narrative-specific enhancements.

- **Specialized Query Types**: Purpose-built queries for different narrative needs:
    - Character queries (psychology, relationships, development)
    - World state queries (locations, factions, objects, conditions)
    - Narrative context queries (themes, plot continuity, motifs)
    - Multi-domain synthesis queries (complex historical analysis)
- **Two-Phase Retrieval Process**:
    - Phase 1: Broad retrieval across memory types using multi-model embeddings
    - Phase 2: Cross-encoder reranking for final result refinement
- **Cross-Reference System**: Core innovation that connects:
    - Entity-to-narrative links (characters/locations → relevant passages)
    - Temporal indexing (story time + narrative order)
    - Thematic tagging (themes, motifs, emotional tones)
    - State change tracking (entity changes linked to causal moments)

This framework enables LORE to coordinate its utilities to access precisely the right information at the right time, ensuring narrative coherence across unlimited storytelling length and maintaining consistent character and world development even for off-screen elements.

[[query_framework]]

## 4.4 Error Recovery

### API Failures
- **Temporary Outage**: Retry strategy with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
- **Content Moderation Rejection**: Alternative prompt formulation
- **Rate Limiting**: Queue system with delayed retry

### Narrative Consistency Issues
- **Character Inconsistency**: `PSYCHE` flags contradictions for correction
- **World State Conflict**: `GAIA` resolves conflicts using confidence scoring
- **Timeline Paradox**: System enforces chronological consistency

### User Interaction
- **Narrative Rejection**: User can request regeneration with modifications
- **Rollback**: System can revert to previous stable state

# 5. Interface Design

## 5.1 User Interface
NEXUS is textual, from front-end to back-end. The UI will serve the centrality and primacy of engaging with high-quality text by presenting a simple, retro terminal-based experience.

Readability will be enhanced by markdown formatting, and a simple retro color scheme.

Design Details:
[[ui_design]]

## 5.2 Command System
- simple parsing with either numbered options or standardized commands for (default) user narrative input, accepting/rejecting new AI-generated content, adjusting settings, etc

# 6 Development Roadmap

## 6.1 Current Status
User is taking Python and SQL courses in order to better understand and guide the development process and its products.
