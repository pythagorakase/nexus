LLM RESPONSE:
<|channel|>analysis<|message|>The user wants: "You are analyzing a narrative. The user asks: 'What happened when Victor betrayed...'" They want identification of key entities to search for, the narrative context type, and natural language queries to find relevant content.

We need to respond with a description: list of key entities (Victor, Alex, maybe others). Narrative context type could be betrayal event, plot twist, conflict. Natural language queries: "Victor betrays Alex", "what happened after Victor's betrayal", etc.

We must follow the instruction: respond in natural language. No disallowed content. Provide answer accordingly.<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**1. Key entities to look for**

- **Victor** – the character who commits the betrayal.  
- **Alex** – the person (or group) that Victor betrays.  
- Any **third‑party witnesses** or “bystanders” who are present when the betrayal occurs (e.g., a confidant, an antagonist, a neutral observer).  
- **Objects or artifacts** tied to the betrayal (e.g., a secret document, a weapon, a coded message, a hidden safe‑house).  
- **Locations** where the betrayal takes place (e.g., a meeting room, a battlefield, a hidden lab, an underground bunker).  
- **Motivation/Goal** – what Victor hopes to gain (power, revenge, survival) and what Alex loses or risks as a result.
