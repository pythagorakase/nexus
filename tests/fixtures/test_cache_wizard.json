The maps still show national borders. Our streets do not.\\n\\nI. ON SOVEREIGNTY\\n\\nNeon Palimpsest is an accord, not a nation. The Intercity Council exists to ratify what the Syndicates have already decided: water allocations, network bandwidth, acceptable protest densities.\\n\\nYou will encounter three primary powers:\\n\\n\\u2022 The Syndicates \\u2013 corporate houses with legacy charters: data-mining dynasties, biofab cartels, logistics guilds that own every road you walk and drone that passes overhead. Their logos hang where flags used to.\\n\\n\\u2022 Compliance Directorates \\u2013 patchwork security forces contracted out by the Syndicates and nominally aligned with the Council. You will know them by their mirrored visors and the way people stop talking when they enter a room.\\n\\n\\u2022 Ghost Networks \\u2013 unlicensed collectives of hackers, archivists, smugglers, and ex-employees who refuse to be updated to the latest terms of service. They are officially myths. You will know them by the gaps in the record where their names should be.\\n\\nNo single entity rules the city. Instead, hundreds of overlapping jurisdictional meshes settle over you like spiderwebs of fine print. You will break a contract today without knowing it. The penalty will arrive before the explanation.\\n\\nII. ON MEMORY\\n\\nAll citizens of Neon Palimpsest are subject to Continuous Experience Capture (CEC) in public zones. Your movements, purchases, gestures, and biometric flares are translated into behavioral metrics and stored in distributed ledgers owned by various partners.\\n\\nThis is for your safety.\\n\\nYour Personal Narrative Score (PNS) will determine where you can live, what contracts you are offered, which doors open, how often the transit drones \\\"happen\\\" to arrive on time for you. A clean, consistent story\\u2014no unexplained blackouts, no contradictory affiliations\\u2014will be rewarded.\\n\\nOf course, stories can be edited.\\n\\nThe city\\u2019s greatest unspoken trade is in memory. Not the blunt theft of accounts and passwords\\u2014any child with a cracked patch of firmware can scrape those\\u2014but the precise erasure of a night, the insertion of a credential you never earned, the quiet relocation of an incriminating timestamp.\\n\\nRumors persist of deep Ghost black-libraries where entire lives can be rewritten: felons reborn as mid-level analysts, test subjects reconstructed as missing heirs. The Syndicates denounce this as impossible. Their denials are very carefully worded.\\n\\nIII. ON SPACE\\n\\nNeon Palimpsest is built in layers.\\n\\nAt street level: the Glow. Saturated holographic signage fights the rain; AR halos bloom around storefronts, people, stray dogs. You will rarely see the actual material of walls and pavement\\u2014only their branded skins.\\n\\nAbove: the Stacks. Informal architectures in welded steel and polymer, home to freelancers, undocumented workers, and mid-tier contractors. Rooftop gardens filter greywater. Micro-ports handle personal drones like gnats clustering at light.\\n\\nBelow: the Roots. Transit arteries, data trunk-lines, storm tunnels converted into unlisted housing and server warrens. Here, the AR fog thins; projectors are sparse. What is remembered belowground is remembered on purpose.\\n\\nThe higher you climb, the more curated reality becomes. At the very top\\u2014executive decks, cloud-bridged sky-lobbies\\u2014sunlight is rationed via subscription, and even the horizon is a licensed experience.\\n\\nIV. ON CUSTOM\\n\\nYou will not be asked your real name.\\n\\nInstead, you will present a handle, a QR sigil, or a reputation hash. People will search you before they greet you. Expect strangers to know your last ten purchases and your last three viral posts. Expect them not to know your eye color, your scent, the sound of your unfiltered voice.\\n\\nTo decline tagging an interaction is a mild insult. To go fully offline in company is an act of aggression. Only the powerful can afford privacy without consequence.\\n\\nPhysical cash exists. You may see it change hands in the Roots, glinting quietly in maintenance alcoves, passed between people whose AR halos flicker with intentional static. If you are offered notes or coins, understand: what you are buying cannot appear on any ledger.\\n\\nV. ON DANGER\\n\\nThe city does not want you dead. It wants you predictable.\\n\\nUnhoused bodies are scooped into sleep programs. Dissidents are funneled into \\\"opinion pilot\\\" groups where their outrage can be modeled, monetized, and steered. Violence is licensed like software: gangs pay for the right to conduct visible theatrics on designated blocks, preferably under the watchful gaze of sponsored drones.\\n\\nThe true violence is quiet: a credibility score nudged downward until your rent spikes and your doctor unsubscribes; a single red flag on a transit corridor that reroutes you every time a certain person enters a station; a background process that harvests your dreams for marketable patterns.\\n\\nHere is the thing you must understand: in Neon Palimpsest, the line between who you are and who your record says you are has snapped. What you remember doing matters less than what the city remembers for you.\\n\\nVI. ON OPPORTUNITY\\n\\nFor those willing to navigate the gaps, this is a golden age.\\n\\nEvery surplus data-cache, every redundant backup server, every half-scrubbed metadata field is a doorway. Ghost runners and identity tailors make fortunes walking the knife-edge between Syndicate contracts and Ghost favors. Courier-kids race through the Roots with corroding hard-drives taped under their jackets, carrying truths that no one is supposed to remember.\\n\\nSomewhere in the Roots, they say, there is a terminal with no input and no output, only a heartbeat of fans in the dark. It does not exist on any network topology. Those who find it may ask the city to forget one thing entirely.\\n\\nNo one agrees on what the price is.\\n\\nVII. CLOSING REMARKS\\n\\nYou are now part of the palimpsest. Your previous lines have been written over, but not erased. Press your fingers to any rain-slicked wall and you may feel the ghost of an older inscription: a protest slogan, a shop\\u2019s name in a dead language, a warning.\\n\\nThe city is always rewriting itself. So can you.\\n\\nJust remember: every revision leaves a trace.\\n\\n// END ORIENTATION 1.1\\n// DO NOT REDISTRIBUTE WITHOUT PROPER CREDENTIALS\",\n  \"political_structure\": \"City-states ruled by corporate syndicates under a hollowed-out international council\"\n}",
