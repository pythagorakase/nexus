A relevance score for each top result (1-5 scale)\n2. Comments on what makes results relevant or irrelevant\n3. Suggestions for improving retrieval quality\n\nPay special attention to the 'user_character' category, which tests the system's ability to connect second-person POV ('your') to the protagonist ('Alex').\n\nNOTE: This file now includes experimental settings for the IR evaluation system.
