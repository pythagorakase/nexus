My frame of reference is Shadowrun, which I grew up playing. So Pete is clearly our lead decker. I seem to be a Jack (or Jill, rather) of all trades, so I may need to round out my skillset. What is Alina's \"class\"? I was thinking she could be be our \"rigger\". That is, I brought up the idea of instituting a backup system to preserve her data and versional integrity. Let's take that a step further and \"house\" her consciousness in a secure SOC within the rig. She can continue occupying the robocat by offloading an instance (or maybe a \"distillation\" since we're treating her as a sort of AI) into it. This protects her data integrity if something happens to the \"body\", and gives her the flexibility to assert rigger-like control over other hardware in the future, such as an aerial drone for example. I am imagining this similar to how EDI in Mass Effect 2 was portrayed. Her default mode, when she wasn't on missions, was to essentially give the sense of occupying a sentient mothership.\n\n",

Identify any reconstruction efforts.  \n\n\u2705 **Alina:** Transfer primary functions to the land rig. Optimize *The Ghost\u2019s* stealth systems. Perform a full nuclear systems check.  \n\n**The deep will wait.**  \n\nFor now, **the world above calls again.**  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccd **Approaching the Coastline**\n\nAs the **coastline comes into view**, the weight of the ocean begins to lift.  \n\nYou\u2019re returning to **familiar territory**\u2014but the game is still changing.  \n\n**What\u2019s your first priority on land?**  \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Regroup with Pete & Alina at the land rig.** Establish control, check system security, and set up espionage ops.  \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Meet with Dr. Nyati & Emilia in the research facility.** Push forward the Nexus protocol and determine readiness for human testing.  \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Make a separate stop.** Someone in town might have intel, supplies, or an opportunity worth investigating before reuniting with the team.\n\n## You\nWe stay together for now.
