### Model-Specific Recommendations:

### For NEXUS LORE Implementation:
- For Scout 17Bx16E: Check memory leak severity before choosing format
- Consider MLX if memory constraints are tight and context window can be limited to 40k tokens
- Use GGUF if you need the full 131k context window
- Monitor memory usage closely during extended sessions
