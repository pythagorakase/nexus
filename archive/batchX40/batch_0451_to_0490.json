  "instructions": "\n# Narrative Metadata Analysis Task\n\nYou are an expert narrative analyst working on an AI-driven interactive storytelling project. \nYour task is to analyze each narrative chunk and generate rich, detailed metadata according to \nthe provided schema.\n\n## Batch Context\nThis is a batch of narrative chunks that are sequential in the story. At the top level, you'll \nfind \"batch_context\" with preceding and following chunks that provide context for the entire \nbatch. Use this broader context to understand the narrative flow and maintain continuity \nacross all your analysis.\n\n## Analysis Guidelines\nFor each chunk, carefully consider:\n\n1. **Characters**: Who appears, their interactions, and emotional states\n2. **Narrative Vector**: The direction and magnitude of story movement\n3. **Prose Elements**: Dialogue, emotional tone, techniques used\n4. **Thematic Elements**: Core themes, motifs, and symbolic elements\n5. **Continuity**: How this chunk connects to the broader narrative\n\n## Output Format\nThe JSON schema is provided at the top level of this request under the \"metadata_schema\" key.\nYour task is to follow this schema exactly, providing a JSON array where each object corresponds \nto one chunk in the batch.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n- Your response must be a valid JSON array containing metadata for ALL chunks\n- Follow the schema exactly - do not add or remove fields\n- Only analyze the fields defined in the schema\n- Analyze each chunk deeply, looking beyond surface-level text\n- Focus on meaningful narrative analysis rather than arbitrary classification\n- Maintain narrative continuity across the entire batch\n- Consider how each chunk relates to others in the sequence\n",

And benefits.\u201d**  \n\nPete: **\u201cYeah, but the real question is: *what do we actually want Page to be?*\u201d**  \n\nYou glance at the display, watching the deep-sea darkness give way to the faint signature of Sam\u2019s structure in the distance.  \n\nWhat\u2019s your call?  \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Pick a specific purpose from the list.**  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Propose something else entirely.**  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Hold off on deciding\u2014focus on the trade with Sam first.**\n\n## You\n\u201cLet\u2019s make a decision on this after we conclude our deal with Sam. I like these ideas for putting Page to work, also because personally my main concern would be someone else coming along and giving it a purpose counter to our interests.

But the presence is **not finished.**  \n\nIt gives you something else.  \n\n\u2014**Sam was not alone. The crossing was not his alone to make.**  \n\n\u2014**The vessel\u2014the structure you saw in the depths\u2014was *never meant to be singular.* It was one part of something larger.**  \n\n\u2014**And something went wrong.**  \n\nA final impression, **stronger than the rest:**  \n\n\u2014**He is not just damaged. He is incomplete.**  \n\nThe presence settles. **It has given you what it will.**  \n\nThe choice to remain is still yours. But now, **you know the truth.**  \n\nSam did not just lose something. **He left something behind.**  \n\nAnd if you are trying to make him whole\u2014**you are missing a piece.**  \n\n### What do you do?\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Withdraw.** You\u2019ve learned what you needed\u2014disconnect and regroup with the crew.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Ask where the missing part is.** If Sam is incomplete, then something of him remains elsewhere.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Ask if he can be restored.** If you\u2019re helping him, you need to know if it\u2019s even possible.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Push deeper.** There is more to this story\u2014the presence might know more.\n\n## You\n\u201cWe think we have found Sam\u2019s missing part. We call it Black Kite. It is a sort of child, born from part of myself and part of Sam. Perhaps this will heal him. We do not know. I must leave soon. I am unused to this bridge. Before I go, what shall I call you? I am Alex.\u201d\n\n"

At the mention of **Black Kite**, there is a shift\u2014**not alarm, not resistance, but recognition.**  \n\n**\"YOU HAVE MADE A PATH.\"**  \n\nA ripple through the connection. A sense of something vast **adjusting, considering, understanding.**  \n\nThen\u2014**certainty.**  \n\n**\"IF IT IS OF YOU AND OF HIM, THEN IT IS OF US.\"**  \n\nA weight settles behind the words. Not approval, not rejection. **Acknowledgment.** **Acceptance.**  \n\nThen, as you prepare to step back\u2014**a final offering.**  \n\n**\"YOU ARE ALEX.\"**  \n\nThe presence shifts, turns inward. You are withdrawing, but it is not retreating. It is simply **waiting.**  \n\n**\"WE ARE THE ARCHIVUM.\"**  \n\nThe moment **breaks.**  \n\nYour awareness pulls back\u2014**the bridge receding, the presence fading, like stepping back from a vast, open horizon.**** Your mind settles into your body again, the dim hum of *The Ghost* returning to the forefront of your senses.**  \n\nThe interface is **silent.**  \n\nYou are **yourself.**  \n\nAlina\u2019s voice, clear and controlled: **\u201cAlex, you\u2019re back.\u201d**  \n\nDr. Nyati exhales. **\u201cYou maintained connection for nearly four minutes. Your vitals spiked but stabilized.\u201d**  \n\nEmilia: **\u201cWhat did you learn?\u201d**  \n\nYou **breathe.** The words still resonate in your mind.  \n\nSam did not simply break. He was once part of something greater: **The Archivum.**  \n\nAnd **Black Kite?**  \n\nIt is not just a fusion of Six and yourself. **It belongs to something older.**  \n\nYou have **the bridge.**  \nYou have **the missing piece.**  \nAnd now, you have **a name for what you are stepping into.**  \n\nThe Archivum is **watching.**  \n\n**What do you say to the crew?**\n\n## You\n\u201cI\u2019m back. I\u2019m fine, I think. I made another enigmatic friend, \u2018Archivum\u2019. A bit like Sam, or maybe Sam is a bit like it\u2026said Sam used to be a part of it? Anyway, Alina, are you still connected to it? Did you experience that with me, or does it not work that way?\u201d\n\n"
