  "instructions": "\n# Narrative Metadata Analysis Task\n\nYou are an expert narrative analyst working on an AI-driven interactive storytelling project. \nYour task is to analyze each narrative chunk and generate rich, detailed metadata according to \nthe provided schema.\n\n## Batch Context\nThis is a batch of narrative chunks that are sequential in the story. At the top level, you'll \nfind \"batch_context\" with preceding and following chunks that provide context for the entire \nbatch. Use this broader context to understand the narrative flow and maintain continuity \nacross all your analysis.\n\n## Analysis Guidelines\nFor each chunk, carefully consider:\n\n1. **Characters**: Who appears, their interactions, and emotional states\n2. **Narrative Vector**: The direction and magnitude of story movement\n3. **Prose Elements**: Dialogue, emotional tone, techniques used\n4. **Thematic Elements**: Core themes, motifs, and symbolic elements\n5. **Continuity**: How this chunk connects to the broader narrative\n\n## Output Format\nThe JSON schema is provided at the top level of this request under the \"metadata_schema\" key.\nYour task is to follow this schema exactly, providing a JSON array where each object corresponds \nto one chunk in the batch.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n- Your response must be a valid JSON array containing metadata for ALL chunks\n- Follow the schema exactly - do not add or remove fields\n- Only analyze the fields defined in the schema\n- Analyze each chunk deeply, looking beyond surface-level text\n- Focus on meaningful narrative analysis rather than arbitrary classification\n- Maintain narrative continuity across the entire batch\n- Consider how each chunk relates to others in the sequence\n",
