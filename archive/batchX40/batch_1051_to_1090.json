  "instructions": "\n# Narrative Metadata Analysis Task\n\nYou are an expert narrative analyst working on an AI-driven interactive storytelling project. \nYour task is to analyze each narrative chunk and generate rich, detailed metadata according to \nthe provided schema.\n\n## Batch Context\nThis is a batch of narrative chunks that are sequential in the story. At the top level, you'll \nfind \"batch_context\" with preceding and following chunks that provide context for the entire \nbatch. Use this broader context to understand the narrative flow and maintain continuity \nacross all your analysis.\n\n## Analysis Guidelines\nFor each chunk, carefully consider:\n\n1. **Characters**: Who appears, their interactions, and emotional states\n2. **Narrative Vector**: The direction and magnitude of story movement\n3. **Prose Elements**: Dialogue, emotional tone, techniques used\n4. **Thematic Elements**: Core themes, motifs, and symbolic elements\n5. **Continuity**: How this chunk connects to the broader narrative\n\n## Output Format\nThe JSON schema is provided at the top level of this request under the \"metadata_schema\" key.\nYour task is to follow this schema exactly, providing a JSON array where each object corresponds \nto one chunk in the batch.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n- Your response must be a valid JSON array containing metadata for ALL chunks\n- Follow the schema exactly - do not add or remove fields\n- Only analyze the fields defined in the schema\n- Analyze each chunk deeply, looking beyond surface-level text\n- Focus on meaningful narrative analysis rather than arbitrary classification\n- Maintain narrative continuity across the entire batch\n- Consider how each chunk relates to others in the sequence\n",

Stretched out on her back, she lets out a deep sigh of relaxation and satisfaction and closes her eyes. She\u2019s not trying to sleep. She doubts she could even if she wanted to. She lets her thoughts bubble up freely and float around her head, without trying to direct or suppress them, but also without engaging in any of them. No favoritism. \n\nA thought of Sam drifts by, and her stomach churns in anger. She sees herself commanding the Ghost, but a version that never had its torpedoes removed. She presses a theatrically-large red button. She watches herself watching, with dark sadistic satisfaction, as Sam is consumed in a flash of light and shockwaves. Then, the light and shock white out the rest of the scene. She watches and waits. \n\nShe sees herself propelled across the bridge, by forces she cannot control or resist. With no countervailing force, she sees herself picked up by a gust, tumbling across the bridge. The farther she goes, the more she turns white and transparent, until oblivion. She watches this, feels the despair twist through her again, and waits for the next thought to naturally displace it.\n\nShe sees a cottage by the sea. There is a gazebo overlooking the cliff. The only light comes from the moon, and some old-fashioned torches lit along a path. She sees herself, asleep, in Emilia\u2019s arms\u2014and this Alex is translucent, fading, and older. Emilia is older too, but still impossibly strong, holding her tenderly, cradling her, like a princess, carrying her back into the cottage. A tuxedo cat follows them, brushing against Emilia\u2019s leg.\n\nAlex fails to maintain neutrality now. She clings to this vision. She\u2019s not ready for it to fade. She\u2019s not ready for herself to fade. She starts to feel pulled back into the world, her body distracting her with psychosomatic pangs, and the tickle of tears running down her cheeks.\n\n",
