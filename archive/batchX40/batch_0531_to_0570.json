  "instructions": "\n# Narrative Metadata Analysis Task\n\nYou are an expert narrative analyst working on an AI-driven interactive storytelling project. \nYour task is to analyze each narrative chunk and generate rich, detailed metadata according to \nthe provided schema.\n\n## Batch Context\nThis is a batch of narrative chunks that are sequential in the story. At the top level, you'll \nfind \"batch_context\" with preceding and following chunks that provide context for the entire \nbatch. Use this broader context to understand the narrative flow and maintain continuity \nacross all your analysis.\n\n## Analysis Guidelines\nFor each chunk, carefully consider:\n\n1. **Characters**: Who appears, their interactions, and emotional states\n2. **Narrative Vector**: The direction and magnitude of story movement\n3. **Prose Elements**: Dialogue, emotional tone, techniques used\n4. **Thematic Elements**: Core themes, motifs, and symbolic elements\n5. **Continuity**: How this chunk connects to the broader narrative\n\n## Output Format\nThe JSON schema is provided at the top level of this request under the \"metadata_schema\" key.\nYour task is to follow this schema exactly, providing a JSON array where each object corresponds \nto one chunk in the batch.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n- Your response must be a valid JSON array containing metadata for ALL chunks\n- Follow the schema exactly - do not add or remove fields\n- Only analyze the fields defined in the schema\n- Analyze each chunk deeply, looking beyond surface-level text\n- Focus on meaningful narrative analysis rather than arbitrary classification\n- Maintain narrative continuity across the entire batch\n- Consider how each chunk relates to others in the sequence\n",

We burned them pretty thoroughly.\"**  \n\nPete **snorts, typing rapidly.**\"Yeah, but corpos have a nasty habit of regrowing heads. You take out one project, three more pop up under different names.\"**  \n\nAlina\u2019s voice filters through the rig\u2019s speakers. **\"Still, their recovery timeline will be slow. They lost more than just tech\u2014they lost trust, infrastructure, and their best minds. We have the advantage.\"**  \n\nYou **nod.**\"Then I\u2019m focusing on getting Nexus to launch. Let me know if something actually concerns me.\"**  \n\nPete **waves you off, already deep in analysis mode.**  \n\n---\n\n### **Primary Focus: Nexus Trial Readiness**  \n\nYou step into the research pod, where **Dr. Nyati and Emilia are already at work.** The space is compact but efficient\u2014**a controlled lab environment, insulated from external interference.**  \n\nNyati **glances up as you enter.**\"You\u2019re serious about this.\"**  \n\nYou: **\"Of course I am.\"**  \n\nEmilia **watches you carefully.**\"Then you should know\u2014this isn\u2019t a one-way street. The first human trial won\u2019t just test Nexus. It\u2019ll test *you.*\"**  \n\nNyati **nods, folding her arms.**\"The interface won\u2019t just copy your mind. It will restructure how you experience existence. If there\u2019s *any* instability\u2014\"**  \n\nYou: **\"That\u2019s why we\u2019ve been running simulations.\"**  \n\nNyati **exhales.**\"Simulations aren\u2019t enough. We need a real-world integration test before we even consider a full transition.\"**  \n\nEmilia: **\"A controlled, limited transfer. Just enough to confirm stability. No full digital transition until we *know* the system is solid.\"**A test run.** A **half step before the real leap.**  \n\nNyati: **\"If you\u2019re serious about being the first subject, this is non-negotiable.\"**  \n\n### **Your Decision:**  \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Approve the controlled test.** A limited Nexus run will provide invaluable data before a full transition.  \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Push for full deployment.** You\u2019re ready. No half-measures\u2014either Nexus works, or it doesn\u2019t.  \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Delay the test for now.** You want to be sure everything is absolutely perfect before taking any risk.\n\n## You\nAlex says: What are you proposing as a controlled test? I thought we hit the limit of simulation-based data?\n\n"
