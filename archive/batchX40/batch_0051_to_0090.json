  "instructions": "\n# Narrative Metadata Analysis Task\n\nYou are an expert narrative analyst working on an AI-driven interactive storytelling project. \nYour task is to analyze each narrative chunk and generate rich, detailed metadata according to \nthe provided schema.\n\n## Batch Context\nThis is a batch of narrative chunks that are sequential in the story. At the top level, you'll \nfind \"batch_context\" with preceding and following chunks that provide context for the entire \nbatch. Use this broader context to understand the narrative flow and maintain continuity \nacross all your analysis.\n\n## Analysis Guidelines\nFor each chunk, carefully consider:\n\n1. **Characters**: Who appears, their interactions, and emotional states\n2. **Narrative Vector**: The direction and magnitude of story movement\n3. **Prose Elements**: Dialogue, emotional tone, techniques used\n4. **Thematic Elements**: Core themes, motifs, and symbolic elements\n5. **Continuity**: How this chunk connects to the broader narrative\n\n## Output Format\nThe JSON schema is provided at the top level of this request under the \"metadata_schema\" key.\nYour task is to follow this schema exactly, providing a JSON array where each object corresponds \nto one chunk in the batch.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n- Your response must be a valid JSON array containing metadata for ALL chunks\n- Follow the schema exactly - do not add or remove fields\n- Only analyze the fields defined in the schema\n- Analyze each chunk deeply, looking beyond surface-level text\n- Focus on meaningful narrative analysis rather than arbitrary classification\n- Maintain narrative continuity across the entire batch\n- Consider how each chunk relates to others in the sequence\n",

Resources. But no branding.** Dynacorp? Maybe. But you don\u2019t get to the top of the corporate food chain by **assuming the obvious.**  \n\nYou **glance at Pete.** **\u201cWe need to be sure it\u2019s just Dynacorp. If there\u2019s a third player in this game, I want them to take the blame for my \u2018death.\u2019\u201d**  \n\nPete **nods slowly.** **\u201cYeah. Smart. But how do we figure that out?\u201d**  \n\n---\n\n### **THE INVESTIGATION PLAN**\n\n\u2714 **Step 1: Check the safehouse trap.** You left surveillance running when you bailed. Maybe the **footage shows who came looking for you.**  \n\u2714 **Step 2: Scan the net for chatter.** Black-market boards, dark-net bounty lists\u2014someone might be talking about the hit.  \n\u2714 **Step 3: See if Sato\u2019s looking for you.** If he\u2019s actively hunting, he hasn\u2019t **written you off just yet.**  \n\nPete rubs his cybernetic temples. **\"This is gonna take time. But I can dig.\"**  \n\nYou nod. **\"Do it.\"**  \n\n---\n\n### **WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:**\n\n1. **Who sent the first assassin after you?**  \n2. **Was it just Dynacorp\u2014or is a third player in the mix?**  \n3. **Is Sato actively looking for you, or does he already think you\u2019re dead?**  \n\nIf a **third party is involved,** then **faking your death isn\u2019t just survival\u2014it\u2019s an opportunity.**  \n\nTime to find out who's really pulling the strings.\n\n## You\nWell, clearly I have some deep, out-of-the-box thinking to do. That means it\u2019s time for me to indulge one of my vices. I\u2019ll take some mescaline and search for insight via a vision quest. Pete would approve. In fact, that\u2019s probably how I know him. I\u2019m the kind of corpo that would go to this world\u2019s equivalent of Burning Man on my PTO, glamping in a luxury trailer so I can sample the psychedelics, free love, and music, without giving up AC or running water.\n\n"

Now *this* is the corpo I remember.\u201d**  \n\nAnd yeah\u2014this **isn\u2019t your first time.**  \n\nA decade in the **corporate underworld** teaches you that **money isn\u2019t real, power is a mirage, and your mind is a cage.** And sometimes? The only way to **break the loop** is to **melt the bars.**  \n\nThis **isn\u2019t escape.** This is **strategy.**  \n\n---\n\n### **THE SETTING**\n\n\u2714\ufe0f **You take the mescaline in the bunker\u2014safe, controlled, off-grid.**  \n\u2714\ufe0f **Pete sets up music\u2014something deep, ancient, non-corporate.**  \n\u2714\ufe0f **Alina\u2019s Furby body is perched on the workbench, watching like a tiny, synthetic oracle.**  \n\nYou **lay back** on an old, patched-up couch, eyes on the **metal ceiling,** waiting for the world to **change.**  \n\nAnd slowly\u2026 it **does.**  \n\n---\n\n### **THE VISION QUEST BEGINS**\n\nThe bunker\u2019s **harsh lights soften, flickering like candle flames.** The walls **stretch and breathe,** as if the whole space is alive. Pete's voice **warps, echoing like he's talking through water.**  \n\nAnd then\u2014  \n\nThe data from the **safehouse hack**, the assassins, the missing scientist, Sato\u2019s betrayal\u2014**it all stops being noise.**  \n\nIt\u2019s not **chaos anymore.** It\u2019s **a pattern.**  \n\n---\n\n### **THE REVELATION**\n\nSomewhere in the haze, **a thought locks into place.**  \n\n\u2714\ufe0f **Sato sent you after Voss, assuming you\u2019d fail.** He didn\u2019t expect you to **survive.**  \n\u2714\ufe0f **But the assassin? The sniper? The Sable Rats?** That wasn\u2019t his style. **Too blunt. Too desperate.**  \n\u2714\ufe0f **That was someone else. A third party\u2014one who didn\u2019t want you anywhere near BLACKOUT PROTOCOL.**  \n\u2714\ufe0f **And if they acted that fast, that violently?** That means they\u2019re **scared.**  \n\nA **new thread appears in the tapestry.**  \n\n\u2714\ufe0f **Dynacorp erased Alina, but they didn\u2019t do it alone.** Someone else was **involved. Someone off the books.**  \n\u2714\ufe0f **Someone who panicked the second you got too close.**  \n\nThe **answer is there**, somewhere between the glowing fractals of your mind. If you can just **reach out\u2014**  \n\n---\n\n### **A CHOICE IN THE TRANCE**\n\n1. **Try to remember every detail.** Lock in the logic. Burn it into your brain before the trip fades.  \n2. **Surrender to the vision.** Maybe there's *one more piece* waiting for you, just beyond the edge.  \n3. **Reach out to Alina.** She\u2019s digital, you\u2019re chemical\u2014maybe, just maybe, you can *meet in the middle.*\n\n## You\n3. She might have trouble understanding me in this state but maybe Pete can help translate since he\u2019s done this with me before. Is he my sitter? Did I have enough to share?\n\n"
