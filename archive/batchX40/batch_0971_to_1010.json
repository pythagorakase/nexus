  "instructions": "\n# Narrative Metadata Analysis Task\n\nYou are an expert narrative analyst working on an AI-driven interactive storytelling project. \nYour task is to analyze each narrative chunk and generate rich, detailed metadata according to \nthe provided schema.\n\n## Batch Context\nThis is a batch of narrative chunks that are sequential in the story. At the top level, you'll \nfind \"batch_context\" with preceding and following chunks that provide context for the entire \nbatch. Use this broader context to understand the narrative flow and maintain continuity \nacross all your analysis.\n\n## Analysis Guidelines\nFor each chunk, carefully consider:\n\n1. **Characters**: Who appears, their interactions, and emotional states\n2. **Narrative Vector**: The direction and magnitude of story movement\n3. **Prose Elements**: Dialogue, emotional tone, techniques used\n4. **Thematic Elements**: Core themes, motifs, and symbolic elements\n5. **Continuity**: How this chunk connects to the broader narrative\n\n## Output Format\nThe JSON schema is provided at the top level of this request under the \"metadata_schema\" key.\nYour task is to follow this schema exactly, providing a JSON array where each object corresponds \nto one chunk in the batch.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n- Your response must be a valid JSON array containing metadata for ALL chunks\n- Follow the schema exactly - do not add or remove fields\n- Only analyze the fields defined in the schema\n- Analyze each chunk deeply, looking beyond surface-level text\n- Focus on meaningful narrative analysis rather than arbitrary classification\n- Maintain narrative continuity across the entire batch\n- Consider how each chunk relates to others in the sequence\n",

I\u2019m trying to put some of the pieces back together. But last time I was out here I was being told that I\u2019m already missing pieces. Or maybe I\u2019m someone else\u2019s missing piece, which they may or may not be looking to reclaim. I\u2019m not ready for that.\u201d Alex\u2019s voice starts to crack a little. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to die, Alina. And that\u2019s what all this feels like. Everything I hear about crossing the goddamned bridge just sounds like a metaphor for death.\u201d\n\n"

Stop being so broken, she tells herself. It\u2019s not sexy for one thing. Then she notices that her cheek has dampened Emilia\u2019s shoulder, and admits to herself she\u2019s lost that battle for the moment. She thinks about saying \u201cI love you\u201d, for the second time ever, but decides against it, admitting to herself she might fall apart, again, if Emilia didn\u2019t echo the words back, again.\n\n"
