  "instructions": "\n# Narrative Metadata Analysis Task\n\nYou are an expert narrative analyst working on an AI-driven interactive storytelling project. \nYour task is to analyze each narrative chunk and generate rich, detailed metadata according to \nthe provided schema.\n\n## Batch Context\nThis is a batch of narrative chunks that are sequential in the story. At the top level, you'll \nfind \"batch_context\" with preceding and following chunks that provide context for the entire \nbatch. Use this broader context to understand the narrative flow and maintain continuity \nacross all your analysis.\n\n## Analysis Guidelines\nFor each chunk, carefully consider:\n\n1. **Characters**: Who appears, their interactions, and emotional states\n2. **Narrative Vector**: The direction and magnitude of story movement\n3. **Prose Elements**: Dialogue, emotional tone, techniques used\n4. **Thematic Elements**: Core themes, motifs, and symbolic elements\n5. **Continuity**: How this chunk connects to the broader narrative\n\n## Output Format\nThe JSON schema is provided at the top level of this request under the \"metadata_schema\" key.\nYour task is to follow this schema exactly, providing a JSON array where each object corresponds \nto one chunk in the batch.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n- Your response must be a valid JSON array containing metadata for ALL chunks\n- Follow the schema exactly - do not add or remove fields\n- Only analyze the fields defined in the schema\n- Analyze each chunk deeply, looking beyond surface-level text\n- Focus on meaningful narrative analysis rather than arbitrary classification\n- Maintain narrative continuity across the entire batch\n- Consider how each chunk relates to others in the sequence\n",

Pete has 90 seconds before he gets *anything.* He has to make a move now.**  \n\n---\n\n### **NEXT MOVE?**\n\n1. **Counter-hack.** Fight off the intruder remotely and keep the data flowing.  \n2. **Trigger a fake emergency.** Start the suppression sequence, but cut it off before it actually destroys anything\u2014forcing an automatic door unlock.  \n3. **Brute force the door.** Blow the lock and escape before Dynacorp can hit the purge switch.\n\n## You\nPrimary response is a decker duel! I trust in Pete\u2019s decking skills to take control of the situation.

Want me to get us set up with some local resources?\"**  \n\n---\n\n### **NEXT MOVE?**\n\n1. **Go straight to Atlanta.** No delays, no distractions\u2014get eyes on the blacksite ASAP.  \n2. **Set up local contacts first.** Get help before diving in\u2014hacker networks, black market suppliers, etc.  \n3. **Do a deeper digital recon first.** Before you even get close, try to pull internal Dynacorp data on the blacksite.\n\n## You\nLooks like we\u2019ve got a 10-12 hour drive ahead of us. Let\u2019s get rolling now, and continue digging for intel on the way. Pete and Alina can team up for a deep digital dive. Meanwhile I\u2019ll keep talking to Sato, friendly-like, with plenty of charm, hoping she\u2019ll open up and tell us more useful intel.\n\n"
