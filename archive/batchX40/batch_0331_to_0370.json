  "instructions": "\n# Narrative Metadata Analysis Task\n\nYou are an expert narrative analyst working on an AI-driven interactive storytelling project. \nYour task is to analyze each narrative chunk and generate rich, detailed metadata according to \nthe provided schema.\n\n## Batch Context\nThis is a batch of narrative chunks that are sequential in the story. At the top level, you'll \nfind \"batch_context\" with preceding and following chunks that provide context for the entire \nbatch. Use this broader context to understand the narrative flow and maintain continuity \nacross all your analysis.\n\n## Analysis Guidelines\nFor each chunk, carefully consider:\n\n1. **Characters**: Who appears, their interactions, and emotional states\n2. **Narrative Vector**: The direction and magnitude of story movement\n3. **Prose Elements**: Dialogue, emotional tone, techniques used\n4. **Thematic Elements**: Core themes, motifs, and symbolic elements\n5. **Continuity**: How this chunk connects to the broader narrative\n\n## Output Format\nThe JSON schema is provided at the top level of this request under the \"metadata_schema\" key.\nYour task is to follow this schema exactly, providing a JSON array where each object corresponds \nto one chunk in the batch.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n- Your response must be a valid JSON array containing metadata for ALL chunks\n- Follow the schema exactly - do not add or remove fields\n- Only analyze the fields defined in the schema\n- Analyze each chunk deeply, looking beyond surface-level text\n- Focus on meaningful narrative analysis rather than arbitrary classification\n- Maintain narrative continuity across the entire batch\n- Consider how each chunk relates to others in the sequence\n",

Air-Gap The Ghost\u2019s Main Systems** \u2013 Temporarily disconnect non-essential external network access, ensuring no data leaks, accidental transmissions, or unwanted inbound signals.  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **4. Sweep for Unknown Processes or Backdoors** \u2013 Double-check SIX\u2019s system for hidden failsafes, tracking scripts, or unnoticed outbound communications.

Lockdown Research Access** \u2013 Restrict the ability to query SIX or its files further until *they* decide it\u2019s safe to proceed.  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **6. Activate Passive Intrusion Detection** \u2013 Start logging *all* inbound/outbound signals at a forensic level to track any attempts at external interference.  \n\n\ud83d\udccc **7. Conduct Full Team Debrief** \u2013 Before taking any next steps, everyone\u2014Alex, Alina, Pete, Nyati, Emilia\u2014needs to be *on the same page* and aware of the stakes before making the next move.  \n\n\ud83d\udea8 **Securing everything does *not* mean stopping the investigation permanently\u2014it just ensures nothing gets out of control before the team is ready.**  \n\nWould you like to proceed with securing everything, or take another action first?\n\n## You\nYes, proceed\n\n",
