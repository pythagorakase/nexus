        "S01E01": "{\"summary\": \"OVERVIEW:\\nThe player-character (an unnamed Dynacorp “Corpo Snake”) accepts a covert mission from executive Victor Sato to recover missing scientist Dr. Alina Voss. Moments later an assassination attempt signals the op is already compromised. Tracing the hitman’s network link leads the Snake to a gang-run server farm where they plant a back-door, steal an encrypted file called BLACKOUT PROTOCOL, and subvert an impending data-purge. Forced off-grid, the Snake flees a breached safehouse, gathers gear and misdirection tools inside Night City, then rides for the Badlands to find eccentric hacker “No-Name Pete” who can break the encryption—all while laying false trails that lure a Dynacorp response team into a fabricated crisis.\\n\\nTIMELINE:\\nTHEN: The episode opens with the Storyteller presenting three life-paths; the player chooses “Corpo Snake.”\\nTHEN: At the Skyline Lounge, Victor Sato offers an off-the-books extraction of Dr. Alina Voss. Accepting after probing for details, the Snake views Voss’s dossier and receives a cryptic neural warning (“Walk away…”).\\nTHEN: Exiting the lounge, the Snake’s HUD triggers a proximity alert; sniper fire smashes the streetfront. The Snake dives behind a holo-ad kiosk and contacts are denied backup.\\nTHEN: Using CityGrid access, the Snake overloads traffic lights, holo-billboards and the local power conduit, creating mass chaos that blinds the sniper.\\nTHEN: While the shooter is disoriented, the Snake hacks his optics, extracts his network signature, and discovers the contract originates from a server in District 07 gang territory (Sable Rats).\\nTHEN: Determined to eliminate the threat source, the Snake steals a Yamaha Ghost bike and rides into District 07.\\nTHEN: Recon shows a fenced shipping yard guarded by Sable Rats. Opting for an original tactic, the Snake deploys a cockroach-sized drone, infiltrates the warehouse and jacks into the server stack.\\nTHEN: A stealthy kernel-layer breach installs a persistent back-door and reveals BLACKOUT PROTOCOL—an ultra-secure Dynacorp file scheduled for purge. The Snake alters the purge script so only file indices delete, leaving data intact, and diverts scrub logs.\\nTHEN: A Sable Rat announces a 24-hour scrub; the Snake’s drone extracts file fragments and escapes undetected. An Unknown Sender taunts the Snake again.\\nTHEN: Back in Night City, the Snake reaches a hidden transit-hub safehouse, loads BLACKOUT PROTOCOL into a high-power decryption rig (6–12 h estimated) and is immediately probed remotely.\\nTHEN: Choosing a honeypot response, the Snake feeds the intruder dummy data, activates cloud-recorded cameras for physical breach footage, powers down the node, and departs with the real shard and a portable decrypt unit.\\nTHEN: Planning Badlands refuge, the Snake evaluates contacts—selects reclusive hacker No-Name Pete and decides to bring a rare tech gift.\\nTHEN: At Dead Circuit boutique, the Snake impresses owner Roxanne Vail with deep knowledge of pre-Collapse hardware, bartering a prototype Dynacorp neural interface for a pristine Kiroshi K-512 cyberdeck (Pete’s likely vice).\\nTHEN: Concerned about electronic trace, the Snake visits Low Tide and buys a matte-black, neon-sheening Nullcloak that dampens RFID, thermal and LiDAR signatures.\\nTHEN: In a District 06 hacker den beneath a noodle shop, the Snake performs a full digital ghosting: erases recent net activity, spoofs biometrics, and inserts false telemetry implying he checked into a luxury corp hotel after hiring private security.\\nTHEN: To deepen the ruse, the Snake transmits a forged high-priority distress signal from the hotel’s security system plus an audio plea for backup, routing it through Dynacorp channels.\\nTHEN: From a nearby parking structure, the Snake observes hotel security lockdown, Dynacorp tactical SUVs, and an unmarked AV staging—confirming the bait worked.\\nTHEN: Satisfied, the Snake powers down onlookers, cloaks up, and rides the Yamaha Ghost toward the desert horizon, heading for No-Name Pete’s missile-silo hideout as night falls.\\n\\nCHARACTERS:\\n{\\\"Corpo Snake\\\": \\\"Dynacorp operative;
