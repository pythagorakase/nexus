# Apex Audition Lane Refactor – Follow-up Suggestions

This note captures actionable improvements identified while reviewing the lane-based refactor. Items are ordered by expected impact.

## 1. Strengthen configuration validation
- Extend `scripts/register_lane_conditions.py` to assert that `reasoning_effort` only contains the allowed enum (`minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`) and that OpenAI reasoning lanes always set `max_output_tokens`. This prevents silent typos in the YAML (e.g., `medum`) from landing in production.
- Consider promoting the validation block to a dedicated helper that can also be imported by the CLI so both entry points share identical guards.

## 2. Add automated coverage for provider parameter wiring
- Introduce unit tests under `tests/audition/` that instantiate the OpenAI and Anthropic providers with lane fixtures and assert that:
  - GPT-5 / o3 payloads omit the `temperature` key and include `reasoning_effort` when routed through both sequential and batch paths.
  - Anthropic payloads propagate `thinking_enabled`/`thinking_budget_tokens` correctly and error when the budget is missing.
- These tests will protect the critical constraints called out in the refactor brief without requiring full integration runs.

## 3. Validate CLI arguments for incompatible combinations
- In `scripts/run_apex_audition_batch.py`, reject `--temperature` when a reasoning model is selected and require `--thinking-budget-tokens` whenever `--thinking-enabled` is passed. The script currently trusts the operator, which makes manual runs easy to misconfigure.
- Emit actionable error messages so operators learn the new rules immediately instead of discovering the failure in the API response.

## 4. Ensure lane IDs are stored for legacy conditions
- Plan a migration (or maintenance script) that backfills `lane_id` for pre-existing conditions and toggles the column to `NOT NULL` once data is consistent. This preserves referential integrity as dashboards pivot to lane-based reporting.
- If backfilling is not feasible, add explicit documentation on how mixed lane/non-lane datasets should be interpreted by analytics jobs.

## 5. Provide an integration smoke test for the 15-lane matrix
- Add a lightweight script (or pytest `@slow` case) that iterates the YAML lanes in `--dry-run` mode to confirm validation passes, then submits a synthetic batch with mocked providers. This would exercise the YAML → engine → batch request flow without burning tokens and will catch drift between configuration and runtime wiring.
