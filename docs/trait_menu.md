This is a flexible trait system to be used for all new characters created in NEXUS. There are ten optional traits, and one required custom trait. The user and Storyteller choose any 3 of the 10, then collaboratively define the wildcard.

This is inspired by the "Background" system in White Wolf's World of Darkness settings. However, in keeping with the Mind's Eye Theatre ethos, these traits are not uniformly advantageous, and they are qualitative rather than quantitative.

Choosing a trait signals you want this aspect of your character to be in the foreground—influencing the story, and generating opportunities or complications.

Not choosing a trait does not mean the character is bereft of it; rather, this signals it's not a focus or a guaranteed source of narrative weight. 

# Optional Traits

## Social Network

### Allies
- will actively help you when it matters
- will take risks for you

### Contacts
- can be tapped for information, favors, or access
- limited willingness to take risks for you; may be transactional or arms-length
- examples: bartender, smuggler, journalist, information broker

### Patron
- powerful figure who mentors, sponsors, protects, or guides you
- has own position to protect; may have own agenda

### Dependents
- lower status/power relative to you, but almost always willing do what you want
- rely on you for some degree support, protection, or guidance
- may be vulnerable, yet devoted
- may be capable, but with limited ability act effectively without your guidance 
- examples: child, employee, subordinate

## Power & Position

### Status
- formal standing recognized by a specific institution or social structure
- examples: military commission, guild journeyman, corporate board seat

### Reputation
- how widely you're known
- what for
- for better or worse
- may or may not confer influence

## Assets & Territory

### Resources
- material wealth, equipment, supplies
- can represent ready access rather than literal possession
- examples: stock portfolio, buried gold, high loan availability via good credit, mineral rights, right to collect tolls on a road or bridge, harvest tithes from a village, access to communal resources

### Domain
- place or area controlled or claimed by character
- examples: condominium, uncontested turf, wizard's tower

## Liabilities
These are story hooks, not punishments.

### Enemies
- actively opposed to you; will expend energy and take risks to thwart you
- goals may be limited (jealous colleague who wants to humiliate you) or unlimited (mortal vengeance)

### Obligations
- can be to individuals, groups, or concepts
- examples: oath, debt collector, filial piety

# Wildcard / Signature

## {variable}
- the only required trait
- defined by user and storyteller
- bespoke to setting, character archetype, and play-style preferences
- should be something that can matter regularly, not a trinket or quirk
- may be a capability or power exclusive to you, with an inherent drawback, e.g., some limited magical ability in an otherwise mundane world—but possibly inciting persecution
- may be a possession or item unique to the setting or not of that world, e.g., binoculars or a modern compound bow in a medieval or earlier setting; or a textbook from the future with world-changing, undiscovered knowledge—but others may try to steal or destroy it
- may be entirely detrimental, e.g., a curse or incurable disease

### Miscellaneous Examples
- a vampire's `herd`
- `symbiote` (AI, xeno-implant, vat-cloned auxiliary cortex)
- `artifact` (sentient sword, unique prototype cyberware)
- a wizard's `familiar`
- `pact` with a deity
- a powerful `secret`
