If so, how can we use that data to guide this undertaking?\n\nAlina, you\u2019ve already accomplished two distillations of yourself, although you did so by focusing on some aspects and omitting others. Figure out if there\u2019s a way to create a representation that\u2019s manageably compact, but holistic. High fidelity, but it doesn\u2019t have to be perfect. For example, FLAC vs a V0 MP3\u2014most people can\u2019t tell the difference, although I hope you can come up with something closer to the former than the latter. Also consider Six\u2019s existing structure; there may be redundancies there. \n\nEmilia, we haven\u2019t heard from you lately. You tell me, what are we not thinking about? Where are our blind spots?\n\n",

But if **understanding itself** was movement\u2014  \n\nThen maybe she *hadn\u2019t stopped.*  \n\nMaybe she *couldn\u2019t stop.*  \n\nHer stomach knots.  \n\nPete mutters, \u201cThis is why I hate this shit.\u201d  \n\nNyati nods. \u201cWe need to know more.

If Halcyon tries to track this, they hit a *dead end.*  \n\u2714 **We disguise the entry point.** The host itself will look like a **junk data server**\u2014something no one would think to monitor.  \n\u2714 **We set a kill switch.** At the first sign of trouble, we cut the power and burn the whole system.

Let\u2019s do this.\u201d**  \n\n---\n\n### **THE FINAL SETUP**\n\n\u2714 **Pete locks in the safehouse construct.**  \n\u2714 **You jack in, but stay outside the meeting space\u2014watching from a hidden console.**  \n\u2714 **Alina enters first.**  \n\u2714 **The trap is set.

If he rushes in, he might be desperate.  \n3. **Any signs of a tail.** If Halcyon is watching him, you need to know *now.*\n\n## You\n3. Also, I want to know how Alina is presenting herself. What is her avatar? I don\u2019t think she can pull off the tech bro act I was doing. She may have to come clean at least about that being a ruse to test the waters.\n\n",

It\u2019s referencing events.\u201d  \n\nAlina processes. \u201cIt is attempting to **place** Sam within a sequence. A before and after.\u201d  \n\nAlex watches as the signal refines, pulses flickering like frames in a broken film. It\u2019s **history**\u2014but fragmented, like an old system trying to reconstruct corrupted memory.  \n\nThen a final pattern emerges, unmistakable in its shape.  \n\nA **split.**  \n\nSomething **cut away.**  \n\nAnd the signal changes again\u2014this time, referencing **Alex.**  \n\nA slow silence settles over the bridge.  \n\nPete mutters, \u201cOh, hell no.\u201d  \n\nNyati exhales. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t just think we know Sam. It thinks we\u2019re part of the same cut.\u201d  \n\nAlex doesn\u2019t move.

As a process.\u201d  \n\nAlex exhales slowly. **A process.**  \n\nNot a person.  \n\nNot a name.  \n\nJust something that had already begun to change.  \n\nShe glances at Emilia. She\u2019s watching, quiet, but her fingers are curled into a loose fist against the console.  \n\nAlex presses her lips together, mind working. *It\u2019s making a connection between me and Sam. It thinks we were part of the same event. Same function. Same cut.*  \n\nBut what did that mean?  \n\nAnd what was it going to do about it?  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udccc CHOICES: HOW DOES ALEX RESPOND?**  \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Challenge the assumption** \u2013 Signal back a correction, asserting that she is not the same as Sam.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Ask for clarification** \u2013 Modify the return signal to request more details on how it perceives the connection.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Push further** \u2013 Encode a signal that asks what happened when Sam was \u201ccut.\u201d  \n\n**What does Alex choose?**\n\n## You\n2. \u201cI don\u2019t know why this rings a bell, but it does.

And look for N.\n\nAlina should deploy a micro drone (cockroach model) to the transfer lab and be ready to cause chaos. Look for opportunities to disrupt operations by destabilizing climate control. They\u2019re not going to proceed with transfers if the heat goes up to 100F and sprinklers go off. She won\u2019t be able to carry off a transfer kit herself, so once I\u2019ve confirmed recovery of a kit she can destroy the rest with EMP pulses or power surges.\n\nLet\u2019s take these separate scenes one at a time: Pete, me, then Alina. Because I\u2019m not going to make any decisive moves until the data is secure, and likewise Alina can play with the thermostat a little but won\u2019t start frying kits until I have one safe.\n\n",

I\u2019d make it work.\u201d*  \n- **Acknowledge it.** *\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d last.\u201d*  \n- **Deflect.** *\u201cCome on, I\u2019m great at retirement. I\u2019ve done it, like, five times.\u201d*  \n- **Something else?**  \n\nBecause **Nyati isn\u2019t buying the answer Alex gave.**  \n\nAnd now?  \n\nShe wants to know if **Alex is buying it herself.**\n\n### **The Hardest Truth\n\n## You\n\u201cI\u2019m going to get tired of all this someday. I don\u2019t know when. And I don\u2019t know how long I have. How long will it take for \u2018bridge syndrome\u2019 to progress all the way? A year? Thirty? Because if I have enough time I could just keep living my life, not giving up on finding another way to stop it. And if I get a good decade or two of bliss with her in a cottage by the sea, then start to fade away and have to sail off into the unknowable like Frodo?\u201d Alex wipes away a tear, takes a deep breath, then gazes over across the dance floor at Emilia. \u201cThat\u2019s not a bad run, all things considered. And maybe\u2026I wouldn\u2019t have to go alone.\u201d She chokes up at the end and can\u2019t say anymore, even if she has more to say. But she doesn\u2019t. Just sniffles, and finally looks back to Nyati, raw and vulnerable.\n\n",

Maybe too many. I want each of you to test a different link in the chain. If one link isn\u2019t sound, we go back to the drawing board. \n\nPete, I need you to make sure this can take place in an airtight sandbox. And we need backups with redundancy. If the result is a no-go, it\u2019s contained and we can roll it back. \n\nDr. Nyati, what have we learned so far from our simulation data? Is it applicable, or not? If so, how can we use that data to guide this undertaking?\n\nAlina, you\u2019ve already accomplished two distillations of yourself, although you did so by focusing on some aspects and omitting others. Figure out if there\u2019s a way to create a representation that\u2019s manageably compact, but holistic. High fidelity, but it doesn\u2019t have to be perfect. For example, FLAC vs a V0 MP3\u2014most people can\u2019t tell the difference, although I hope you can come up with something closer to the former than the latter. Also consider Six\u2019s existing structure; there may be redundancies there. \n\nEmilia, we haven\u2019t heard from you lately. You tell me, what are we not thinking about? Where are our blind spots?\n\n",

Now I get to do something *fun*.\u201d**  \n\nHe\u2019s already **pulling up schematics**, rerouting old **black-market backdoors**, and pulling together a **customized, high-security relay.**  \n\n**\u201cAlright, listen up.

If Halcyon tries to track this, they hit a *dead end.*  \n\u2714 **We disguise the entry point.** The host itself will look like a **junk data server**\u2014something no one would think to monitor.  \n\u2714 **We set a kill switch.** At the first sign of trouble, we cut the power and burn the whole system. No traces.  \n\u2714 **We use a controlled environment.** Instead of meeting in open cyberspace, we make **a locked server-room construct**\u2014so *Lansky* is stepping into *our* space, not the other way around.  \n\n---\n\n### **THE MEETING SPACE**\n\nPete pulls up a **virtual construct model**, a **secure and contained digital room** that looks **like a high-rise executive office from a corporate skyscraper.**  \n\n\u2714 **Artificial windows with a cityscape simulation.** Looks real, but there\u2019s *nothing beyond it.*  \n\u2714 **Fake security cams.** Just to make Lansky wonder if someone else is watching.  \n\u2714 **A single table and two chairs.** Simple. Controlled. No distractions.  \n\u2714 **Firewall-locked exits.** You *choose* when the meeting is over.  \n\nPete **grins.** **\u201cThis is gonna be the most uncomfortable job interview of this guy\u2019s life.\u201d**  \n\n---\n\n### **PREPPING ALINA**\n\nAlina **watches the environment load, her LED eyes flickering.**  \n\n**\u201cIt\u2019ll work.

If he knows this is a controlled space, he might refuse to step in.\u201d**  \n\nPete **nods.** **\"That\u2019s why we give him just *enough* control to make him *think* he has an exit.\"**  \n\n\u2714 **We leave one \"open\" door\u2014but it\u2019s a decoy.** Looks like a way out, but actually leads to a closed loop.  \n\u2714 **We don\u2019t push him.** The more comfortable he feels, the more he\u2019ll talk.  \n\u2714 **Alina goes in alone at first.** If Lansky reacts badly, she can *stall* while you and Pete watch from the outside.  \n\nShe shifts, as if **rolling her shoulders**, even though she doesn\u2019t have any. **\u201cAlright. Let\u2019s do this.\u201d**  \n\n---\n\n### **THE FINAL SETUP**\n\n\u2714 **Pete locks in the safehouse construct.**  \n\u2714 **You jack in, but stay outside the meeting space\u2014watching from a hidden console.**  \n\u2714 **Alina enters first.**  \n\u2714 **The trap is set. Now, it\u2019s time to see if Lansky walks in.**  \n\nPete **smirks.** **\"Showtime, kids.\"**  \n\n---\n\n### **WHAT DO YOU WATCH FOR?**\n\n1. **Lansky\u2019s avatar.** What form he takes might tell you how much of his humanity is left.  \n2. **How quickly he enters.** If he hesitates, he doesn\u2019t trust you. If he rushes in, he might be desperate.  \n3. **Any signs of a tail.** If Halcyon is watching him, you need to know *now.*\n\n## You\n3. Also, I want to know how Alina is presenting herself. What is her avatar? I don\u2019t think she can pull off the tech bro act I was doing. She may have to come clean at least about that being a ruse to test the waters.\n\n",

The jagged pulses smooth out, forming a **sequence**\u2014no longer a single shape, but a pattern.  \n\nA **timeline.**  \n\nNyati leans forward. \u201cWait. It\u2019s referencing events.\u201d  \n\nAlina processes. \u201cIt is attempting to **place** Sam within a sequence. A before and after.\u201d  \n\nAlex watches as the signal refines, pulses flickering like frames in a broken film. It\u2019s **history**\u2014but fragmented, like an old system trying to reconstruct corrupted memory.  \n\nThen a final pattern emerges, unmistakable in its shape.  \n\nA **split.**  \n\nSomething **cut away.**  \n\nAnd the signal changes again\u2014this time, referencing **Alex.**  \n\nA slow silence settles over the bridge.  \n\nPete mutters, \u201cOh, hell no.\u201d  \n\nNyati exhales. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t just think we know Sam. It thinks we\u2019re part of the same cut.\u201d  \n\nAlex doesn\u2019t move. She stares at the display, mind already running three moves ahead.  \n\nSam was **not whole.**  \n\nAnd the Cradle-dweller\u2014whatever it was\u2014thought *she* was part of the same equation.  \n\nShe meets Alina\u2019s gaze. \u201cDoes it recognize me?\u201d  \n\nAlina hesitates. \u201cNot as an individual. As a process.\u201d  \n\nAlex exhales slowly. **A process.**  \n\nNot a person.  \n\nNot a name.  \n\nJust something that had already begun to change.  \n\nShe glances at Emilia. She\u2019s watching, quiet, but her fingers are curled into a loose fist against the console.  \n\nAlex presses her lips together, mind working. *It\u2019s making a connection between me and Sam. It thinks we were part of the same event. Same function. Same cut.*  \n\nBut what did that mean?  \n\nAnd what was it going to do about it?  \n\n---\n\n### **\ud83d\udccc CHOICES: HOW DOES ALEX RESPOND?**  \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Challenge the assumption** \u2013 Signal back a correction, asserting that she is not the same as Sam.  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Ask for clarification** \u2013 Modify the return signal to request more details on how it perceives the connection.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Push further** \u2013 Encode a signal that asks what happened when Sam was \u201ccut.\u201d  \n\n**What does Alex choose?**\n\n## You\n2. \u201cI don\u2019t know why this rings a bell, but it does. Didn\u2019t we find a reference to me somewhere weird before?\u201d\n\n",

If exposure itself moves the process forward, then just **being in contact** could be enough.\u201d  \n\nAlex presses her fingers against the bridge of her nose. \u201cSo, what? I\u2019m still moving forward even when I don\u2019t mean to?\u201d  \n\nAlina steps in, voice level. \u201cNot necessarily.

After the second trip in.\u201d  \n\nAlex frowns. \u201cYeah?\u201d  \n\nEmilia meets her eyes. \u201cYou said it felt like you were standing in a room. But now you *know* where the edges are.\u201d  \n\nAlex stills.  \n\n\u201cI think,\u201d Emilia continues, measured, \u201cthat was a step.\u201d  \n\nThe realization clicks.  \n\nAlex had been thinking of *steps* as deliberate, conscious choices. But if **understanding itself** was movement\u2014  \n\nThen maybe she *hadn\u2019t stopped.*  \n\nMaybe she *couldn\u2019t stop.*  \n\nHer stomach knots.  \n\nPete mutters, \u201cThis is why I hate this shit.\u201d  \n\nNyati nods. \u201cWe need to know more.
