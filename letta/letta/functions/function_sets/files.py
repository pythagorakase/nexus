    """Open one or more files and load their contents into files section in core memory. Maximum of 5 files can be opened simultaneously.

    Use this when you want to:
    - Inspect or reference file contents during reasoning
    - View specific portions of large files (e.g. functions or definitions)
    - Replace currently open files with a new set for focused context (via `close_all_others=True`)

    Examples:
        Open single file belonging to a directory named `project_utils` (entire content):
            file_requests = [FileOpenRequest(file_name="project_utils/config.py")]

        Open multiple files with different view ranges:
            file_requests = [

        Close all other files and open new ones:
            open_files(agent_state, file_requests, close_all_others=True)

    Args:
        file_requests (List[FileOpenRequest]): List of file open requests, each specifying file name and optional view range.
        close_all_others (bool): If True, closes all other currently open files first. Defaults to False.

    Searches file contents for pattern matches with surrounding context.

    Results are paginated - shows 20 matches per call. The response includes:
    - A summary of total matches and which files contain them
    - The current page of matches (20 at a time)
    - Instructions for viewing more matches using the offset parameter

    Example usage:
        First call: grep_files(pattern="TODO")
        Next call: grep_files(pattern="TODO", offset=20)  # Shows matches 21-40

    Returns search results containing:
    - Summary with total match count and file distribution
    - List of files with match counts per file
    - Current page of matches (up to 20)
    - Navigation hint for next page if more matches exist

    Args:
        pattern (str): Keyword or regex pattern to search within file contents.
        include (Optional[str]): Optional keyword or regex pattern to filter filenames to include in the search.
        context_lines (Optional[int]): Number of lines of context to show before and after each match.
                                       Equivalent to `-C` in grep_files. Defaults to 1.
        offset (Optional[int]): Number of matches to skip before showing results. Used for pagination.
                                For example, offset=20 shows matches starting from the 21st match.
                                Use offset=0 (or omit) for first page, offset=20 for second page,
                                offset=40 for third page, etc. The tool will tell you the exact
