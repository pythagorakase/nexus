"""
Letta Filesystem

This demo shows how to:
1. Create a folder and upload files (both from disk and from strings)
2. Create an agent and attach the data folder
3. Stream the agent's responses
4. Query the agent about the uploaded files

The demo uploads:
- A text file from disk (example-on-disk.txt)
- A text file created from a string (containing a password)
- The MemGPT paper PDF from arXiv

Then asks the agent to summarize the paper and find passwords in the files.
