    "dynamic": "From Alex’s perspective Sam is an unsettling oracle who hands out half–truths and impossible gifts, then hides behind riddles when the consequences hit.  She is furious that the Bridge is eroding her autonomy, yet still pulled toward the knowledge only Sam seems able to unlock.  Every exchange now feels like negotiating with a grenade whose pin has already been pulled—she keeps talking because she still hopes the angle of the blast can be changed.",
    "recent_events": "• Alex ‘listened’ with the Bridge and felt it accelerate her Crossing, realising Sam had understated the risk.\n• She confronted Sam via comms after the Cradle-incident, accusing him of breaking and poisoning her; his calm replies only deepened her anger.\n• Sam admitted the Bridge cannot be set down once carried, confirming Alex’s worst fear and turning her curiosity into resentful vigilance.",
    "history": "— First contact in the trench: Alex negotiated the trade of Black Kite for the Bridge, finding Sam cryptic but seemingly helpful.\n— Approach sequence: Alex physically entered Sam’s vessel; he allowed proximity and reaffirmed the bargain, creating a fragile trust.\n— Bridge Lesson: Sam taught Alex to ‘listen,’ after which she experienced intrusive visions and realised the process is irreversible; trust cracked.\n— Cradle mission: signals implied Alex is already ‘in progress’; anger toward Sam flared when she understood the cost he had concealed.\n— Current state: Alex sees Sam as a dangerous source of indispensable knowledge—she will keep dealing with him, but every interaction is laced with suspicion and simmering rage.",

    "dynamic": "Sam views Alex as a rare mind willing to step toward the unknown without fleeing, an unfinished traveller whose progress he watches with measured curiosity.  He feels no malice toward her anger; to him her resentment is a predictable phase of carrying the Bridge.  While he respects her agency he will not alter his own course—he believes Alex will, in time, value the path he opened for her.",
    "recent_events": "• He granted Alex permission to ‘listen,’ observing her first successful sensory crossing and noting that she returned instead of pressing on.\n• During Nyati’s furious interrogation he acknowledged knowing the Bridge would bind Alex but maintained that she asked for sight; her rage did not change his assessment of her importance.\n• Provided coordinates to an inland vault when Nyati begged for a cure, indicating willingness to assist if the request aligns with his broader goals.",
    "history": "— Initial sonar dialogue: Sam recognised Alex’s pattern of inquiry and responded, perceiving her as ‘one who cuts.’\n— Trade of Black Kite for the Bridge: He judged Alex reliable enough to carry forward a fragment of his lost network.\n— Physical audience: Allowed The Ghost into his hull, signalling unusual trust; defined Alex as ‘small but reaching.’\n— Bridge lesson: Chose Alex to receive first-step instruction, believing her connections (anchors) make her likelier to survive.\n— Current stance: Watches her progression with detached investment; he will advise or test her, but will not intervene to reverse the bond he deems purposeful.",
