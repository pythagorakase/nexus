    "dynamic": "From Alex’s vantage, Naomi Kurata is the sharp new knife Dynacorp just drew—an ice-blooded executive who slipped into Sato’s seat and immediately started locking doors Alex once walked through. Alex respects the precision of the move but reads it as a direct threat: Kurata is the fulcrum of corporate power that could sever any hope of reclaiming leverage inside the company. For now Alex keeps a professional distance, treating Kurata like a chess piece to be studied, subverted, or sacrificed when the timing is right.",
    "recent_events": "• Pete’s probe revealed Kurata’s lightning-fast promotion and her fingerprints on Project Echo’s access list, marking her as the new obstacle.\n• Alex added Kurata to the ‘watch and exploit later’ docket, debating infiltration versus sabotage while postponing direct engagement.\n• The discovery that Kurata may be Halcyon-aligned reframed her from mere rival to potential keystone in a wider conspiracy.",
    "history": "Initially, Kurata was a name buried in Risk Containment memos while Alex still wore a Dynacorp badge. After Alex’s flight, Sato’s disappearance created a power vacuum; within hours Kurata filled it, rewriting access tables and moving assets. The first clear intersection came when Alex scraped archive logs and saw Kurata appended to Project Echo’s clearance—an unmistakable signal that their objectives would collide. Since then the relationship has lived in dataspace: Alex mapping Kurata’s networks, Kurata tightening them, neither yet crossing the line into personal confrontation.",

    "dynamic": "To Naomi Kurata, Alex Ward is an inconvenient ghost of Dynacorp’s past—an escaped asset who embodies both risk and embarrassment. Kurata’s mandate is to sanitize Echo’s history and cement her reign; until Alex is neutralized or recaptured, that mandate remains incomplete. She regards Alex less as a rival worthy of negotiation and more as hazardous residue to be contained before it poisons her strategic tableau.",
    "recent_events": "• Kurata assumed Sato’s portfolio and immediately saw archived flags on EXEC-DELTA-17, triggering a quiet threat-assessment review.\n• Access logs showed an external scrape of low-level project data (Pete’s spoofed login), convincing Kurata that Alex’s network is already probing her perimeter.\n• Internal briefings with Risk Containment framed Alex as ‘high-priority fugitive,’ authorizing discretionary force if encountered.",
    "history": "Kurata likely knew of Alex only in passing while heading Risk Containment, cataloguing DELTA-class operatives as potential liabilities. After Sato vanished, her first audit revealed Alex’s defection and involvement in the Echo breach. Each new data leak—culminating in the recent archive intrusion—reinforced her view that Alex is a destabilizing vector. Kurata’s policy hardened from watch-list to elimination order; every security tightening and board presentation since has included a slide on ‘EXEC-DELTA-17 risk mitigation.’",
