    "dynamic": "Alex sees Smiley as a dependable, good-humored fixer whose scruffy nomad network can be aimed like a precision tool. While she respects that he runs on profit and independence, she enjoys the easy banter and the way he turns her corporate schemes into dusty street theater. Their rapport is transactional at the core, yet laced with genuine camaraderie born of shared thrills at outwitting bigger predators.",
    "recent_events": "• Smiley answered Pete’s call within minutes, rolling up with a biker crew to harass the Vox surveillance van until it pulled out.\n• He let Alex’s team camp with the nomads and blend into the convoy, providing cover for their escape from the bunker.\n• Acting as broker, he located and sold Alex a heavily modified Dynacorp hauler, cementing his value as a go-between for black-market gear.",
    "history": "Initially just a name in Pete’s comm list, Smiley proved himself when Alex needed a soft strike against Vox—his rapid response and showman’s flair impressed her. The successful distraction opened a pattern: Alex floats a risky favor, Smiley delivers in exchange for creds or future consideration. Camping with the convoy deepened trust, showing he could protect her anonymity. The armored hauler deal formalized their ongoing arrangement: she supplies payment and high-stakes gigs; he supplies mobility, misdirection, and access to nomad trade lanes.",

    "dynamic": "Smiley regards Alex as the rare corpo who pays on time, takes jokes, and isn’t afraid to get a little dirt on her boots. He senses the danger orbiting her but also the profit, so he keeps the tone light and the exits clear. Beneath the sales-pitch grin, he respects her tactical mind and likes the thrill of poking megacorps in the eye alongside her.",
    "recent_events": "• Took Alex’s contract to crowd-out a Vox surveillance van, earning easy creds and bragging rights.\n• Shared campfire drinks while Alex’s crew hid among his nomads, confirming she treats partners well.\n• Closed a high-margin sale on a tricked-out hauler, reinforcing that Alex is both decisive and flush.",
    "history": "Their first real interaction came via Pete’s crackly comm line; Smiley judged the job low-risk fun and said yes. The harassment stunt went off without a hitch, boosting his standing among the nomads. Seeing Alex mingle by the fires, he revised his mental file from ‘slick suit’ to ‘resourceful fugitive worth cultivating.’ The vehicle sale added a deeper layer of commerce and mutual benefit, setting precedent for future deals whenever Alex strays into the Badlands or needs nomad muscle.",
