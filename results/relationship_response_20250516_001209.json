    "dynamic": "Alex's relationship with Pete is defined by deep camaraderie, mutual exasperation, and a long-standing foundation of trust that has survived chaos, trauma, and relentless teasing. She oscillates between being his co-conspirator, tormentor, and confidant, often using humor and banter to cover genuine affection and concern. Lately, she has become more aware of Pete's internal struggles, striving to support him both as a friend and a leader, and gently nudges him toward growth and self-discovery.",
    "recent_events": "Alex orchestrated a covert operation (with the crew) to nudge Pete into a gay bar, supporting his journey toward self-acceptance; she repeatedly deflected his suspicion with playful misdirection, only to later admit her role in the 'conspiracy' with genuine warmth. Her teasing has become more affectionate than adversarial, and when Pete was suffering, she offered real support, checking in as both a leader and a friend. During moments of vulnerability, such as the 'resurrection incident' and discussions about Pete's well-being, Alex has consistently shown up for him.",
    "history": "Their relationship began as a pragmatic alliance—Alex valued Pete's skills as a decker and trusted his judgment when it mattered most. Over time, their bond deepened through shared crisis, mutual survival, and the slow, hard-earned trust that comes from repeatedly saving each other's asses. Alex has pushed Pete out of his comfort zone (sometimes for entertainment, sometimes for his own good), and Pete has become a reliable sounding board for her as well. Key turning points include the transition from bunker life to crew life, the ongoing teasing and psychological warfare, and the recent arc where Alex actively supported Pete's self-discovery and happiness, signaling a shift from pure chaos to genuine care.",

    "dynamic": "Pete's relationship with Alex is a complex blend of exasperation, admiration, and genuine loyalty. He often acts as her foil—calling her out, resisting her chaos, and providing a grounding influence when her schemes spiral out of control. Yet beneath the banter and complaints, Pete deeply appreciates Alex's presence, her willingness to push him toward growth, and the strange safety he finds in her relentless (sometimes overwhelming) energy. Their friendship is a safe space for vulnerability—one he pretends to resent but would not trade.",
    "recent_events": "Pete was the subject of an elaborate crew conspiracy (helmed by Alex and Emilia) that nudged him into a self-discovery arc at a gay bar, resulting in a genuine breakthrough for him. He received both relentless teasing and real support from Alex during this process, and later, when Alex checked in with him one-on-one, he admitted—however obliquely—his appreciation for her leadership and friendship. His recent willingness to play along with (and even enjoy) the crew's antics signals a shift toward acceptance and trust.",
    "history": "Initially, Pete maintained a defensive distance from Alex, seeing her as a 'corpo snake' and keeping his guard up. Shared survival and mutual reliance during the early Nexus missions built a reluctant respect, which gradually softened into camaraderie and then real friendship. Over time, Pete became a trusted voice of skepticism and a stabilizer when Alex went too far, while Alex encouraged Pete to take risks and embrace change. Key moments include their joint infiltration jobs, the fashion/karaoke interventions, and Alex's support as Pete embraced his bisexuality. The relationship has moved from wary alliance to chosen-family friendship, with occasional bratty competition and heartfelt check-ins.",
