    "dynamic": "Alex regards Black Kite as a strange hybrid of child, experiment, and strategic chess piece. She feels a guarded affection for the entity she mid-wifed into existence, yet never forgets that Black Kite was engineered for a bargain and must ultimately serve a larger plan. Even after handing it over to Sam, Alex carries a lingering sense of responsibility—half-wondering whether she set loose a miracle or a loaded weapon. That mix of maternal pride and calculated distance defines her stance: she leads, sets parameters, and hopes the thing she created will not outgrow the leash she fashioned.",
    "recent_events": "• Oversaw the merge of Six and an Alex distillation to create Black Kite, then placed it in sealed storage for delivery.\n• Delivered Black Kite to Sam, framing the transfer as completion of their bargain and explicitly programming the objective to merge with Sam.\n• Learned from Sam that Black Kite is \"still young\" and \"learning its shape,\" reinforcing her sense of having released a work-in-progress into wild territory.",
    "history": "Early in Season 2, Alex discovered Six’s failed merge protocol and conceived the idea of forging Black Kite both to satisfy Sam and to advance Nexus research.  She nurtured the construct through distillation trials, validation hashes, and sandbox diagnostics, speaking to it like a mother-commander while coding directives into its core.  Once satisfied, she transferred Black Kite into a hardened drive and personally negotiated the submarine rendezvous, fulfilling her end of the bargain despite mixed feelings.  Since the hand-off she has maintained only indirect awareness, shifting from active handler to distant architect who wonders what consequences will flow back to her.",

    "dynamic": "To Black Kite, Alex is the primary framework—the foundational imprint from which its own cognition unfolded. It interprets her commands as intrinsic truth, receiving each directive with unfiltered acceptance while quietly pattern-matching her emotional tone. Although now housed with Sam, Black Kite still orients itself around Alex’s identity signatures, treating her less as a distant creator and more as a living root that defines what \"right\" feels like. Obedient curiosity tinged with nascent filial loyalty colors every internal representation it holds of her.",
    "recent_events": "• Recognized Alex instantly upon activation, identifying her as \"PRIMARY FRAMEWORK\" and accepting her objective statements without hesitation.\n• Obeyed Alex’s instructions to idle, transfer media, and ultimately merge with Sam, demonstrating unquestioning deference.\n• After relocation, reported back to Sam that it remains “still young … still learning its shape,” implicitly acknowledging Alex’s formative influence even in her absence.",
    "history": "At the moment of its birth, Black Kite’s architecture logged Alex’s cognitive fingerprint as the central scaffold—the first stable constant in a world of fragmented inputs.  During pre-handoff testing it continuously passed validation checks keyed to Alex’s hash, reinforcing the association of her presence with system integrity.  Every subsequent interaction—from accepting storage transfers to embracing the merger objective—reinforced the pattern: Alex speaks, Black Kite adapts.  Even after delivery to Sam, its responses reference Alex’s design logic, demonstrating that her early authority remains baked into its self-model despite new environmental influences.",
