    "dynamic": "Alex regards Raven as a sharp, play-by-play adversary turned mutually beneficial node in her widening network. She enjoys the woman’s ability to pivot mid-negotiation and even finds the dry humor disarming, but the open-ended favor means Alex keeps one eye on the scoreboard. For now Raven is filed under \"useful, potentially trustworthy, never unmonitored,\" the kind of link Alex intends to cultivate without surrendering leverage.",
    "recent_events": "• Raven abandoned her all-or-nothing ploy after Alex’s feigned perplexity, signaling adaptive respect.\n• They sealed the exchange with a handshake that transferred two intel packages in return for an undefined future favor.\n• Shared banter over Spice-Girl codenames broke the final tension, leaving Alex amused and mildly impressed.",
    "history": "– Contact established indirectly through Alina’s New Orleans lead.\n– First face-to-face meeting: Raven’s leverage test met Alex’s counter-questioning, flipping initiative to Alex.\n– Negotiation evolved from rigid pricing to an open-ended favor after Alex dismissed Raven’s framing as \"weird.\"\n– Deal closed with firm handshake; relationship now anchored by a single outstanding favor and mutual curiosity about each other’s networks.",

The favor in Raven’s ledger gives her comfortable leverage, but Alex’s quick wit has earned genuine professional respect.",

    "history": "– Initial intel drop arranged through Alina, but Raven’s real curiosity centered on Alex’s reputation.\n– First meeting tested Alex with an all-or-nothing offer; Alex’s amused pushback revealed a negotiator worth cultivating.\n– Raven shifted to an access-for-favor model, cementing a longer horizon connection.\n– Departure left Raven satisfied, amused, and already plotting situations where Alex’s vouching power could be decisive.",
