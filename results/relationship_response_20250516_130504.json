    "dynamic": "Rox strikes Alex as a rare, sharp-eyed purveyor of the past—exactly the kind of niche resource a fugitive technocrat keeps on speed-dial. He respects her discernment and enjoys the delicate dance of half-truths required to win her cooperation, even as he compartmentalizes any concern about the lethal prototype he just handed over. For Alex, she is both a potential ally and a potential liability, so the relationship is threaded with calculated cordiality.",
    "recent_events": "• Alex entered Dead Circuit under a spoofed Dynacorp exec ID and impressed Rox with granular knowledge of the Kiroshi K-512.\n• He negotiated a barter: a pristine cyberdeck in exchange for Dynacorp’s experimental neural interface, with an implicit promise of a future favor.\n• Alex left the shop with the deck—and the awareness that Rox now possesses dangerous tech that might circle back on him.",
    "history": "Their connection began the moment Alex, on the run from Dynacorp, targeted Dead Circuit as the only place that could supply a period-correct cyberdeck. Initial tension—Rox treating him as a poser—shifted when he demonstrated deep technical fluency, earning her guarded respect. The single high-stakes trade cemented a pragmatic rapport and opened the door to future dealings, but no further contact has occurred yet.",

    "dynamic": "To Rox, Alex is a polished but dangerous corpo exile—someone who speaks her language well enough to be useful yet reeks of hidden agendas. The prototype he traded is a tantalizing treasure and a potential death trap, underscoring that any deal with him is a walk along a knife’s edge. She files him under \"profitable until proven otherwise,\" keeping curiosity and caution in tight balance.",
    "recent_events": "• Alex appeared unannounced, flashed deep-cut knowledge of the K-512, and talked her past the usual poser filters.\n• Rox accepted his Dynacorp neural interface in lieu of 40k creds, gaining both a priceless artifact and a callable favor.\n• Examining the untested wetware prompted Rox to run extra diagnostics and mentally prepare contingencies should the device prove lethal.",
    "history": "Their entire association is contained in a single, charged negotiation. Rox’s first impression—spoiled corpo tourist—shifted when Alex demonstrated authentic expertise, triggering professional respect mixed with suspicion. The barter finalized their contact: Rox gained a prototype and leverage, Alex walked out with the deck. Since that night she has neither called in the favor nor heard from him, but she has tagged him as a high-value, high-risk asset for future schemes.",
