    "dynamic": "Alex reads Raven as a rare breed of broker—sharp, adaptable, and impossible to bully—so the usual corporate mind games give way to amused sparring. She finds the woman’s refusal to posture refreshing, even as she notes the latent cost of the open-ended favor now hanging over her head. For Alex, Raven is both a useful asset and an intriguing wildcard, worthy of courtesy but never of unguarded trust.",
    "recent_events": "• In their first face-to-face, Alex sidestepped Raven’s leverage play by treating the all-or-nothing offer as illogical, forcing a rule-change in the negotiation.\n• Alex secured both intel packages in exchange for a future favor, sealing the deal with a firm handshake and a round of irreverent Spice-Girl codenames that made Raven laugh.\n• The quiet acknowledgment—Raven’s amused \"let’s see if you stay worth the favor\"—cemented an ongoing ledger rather than a one-off exchange.",
    "history": "Day 0: Raven, contacted through Alina, arranged a public café meet to sell Echo leak data and survivor-tracking logs.\nMinute 10: Raven opened with a pressure test, offering an all-or-nothing deal; Alex’s confused pushback forced her to reveal the ploy’s motive.\nMinute 20: Negotiation flipped; Alex demanded both packages, Raven countered with payment by favor.\nMinute 25: Scope of favor clarified—no assassinations, no suicide runs, just access and reputation work.\nMinute 30: Handshake, data transfer, and mutual amusement over Spice-Girl callsigns closed the meeting. Relationship is newborn but already framed as an open future engagement.",

The encounter marks Alex as a high-value, entertaining client—someone worth investing in for the long game. Raven respects Alex’s wit and reach, but keeps one mental bookmark on the favor she can call when opportunity strikes.",
