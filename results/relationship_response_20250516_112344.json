    "dynamic": "Alex treats Bishop as a razor-reliable black-market fulcrum: distant enough to be safe, indispensable enough to warrant respect. She admires his surgical efficiency and mirrors it, couching every request in precise terms and prompt payment while keeping her deeper motives veiled. Underneath the professional polish lies a quiet awareness that Bishop’s courtesy is conditional, and any slip could flip him from asset to executioner.",
    "recent_events": "• Green-lit Pete’s plan to hire Bishop, opening an encrypted relay that led to their first direct negotiation.\n• Conducted a terse, option-driven call in which Bishop laid out three submarines; Alex chose The Ghost and confirmed she would meet all terms.\n• Ongoing: Bishop is now laundering ownership and arranging modifications while Alex prepares the crew and funds, reinforcing the rhythm of need–deliver–disappear.",
    "history": "Early in her flight from Dynacorp, Alex earmarked Bishop’s netrunner den as a possible bolt-hole but never pulled the trigger. Weeks later, facing the need for a mobile lab, she contacted him through Pete, establishing a strictly business rapport founded on reputation and escrow. Their dialogue has remained minimalist—Bishop offers impossibly large assets, Alex pays without fuss—but each successful transaction deepens mutual confidence. So far the pattern is unbroken: Alex asks once, Bishop delivers once, and both vanish back into the dark until the next impossible requisition.",

    "dynamic": "From Bishop’s vantage, Alex is the rare client who understands the cost of discretion and pays on time, making her valuable but never indispensable. He respects her clarity and lack of small talk, logging her under \"reliable repeat business\" while keeping contingency files should she ever wobble. Sentiment does not enter the equation—only risk indices and profit margins—but each clean transaction nudges the slider from neutral to quietly approving.",
    "recent_events": "• Received first contact via Pete, vetted Alex’s creditworthiness in seconds, and opened a secure channel.\n• Presented three submarines and noted Alex’s swift, informed choice of The Ghost, a data point flagged as ‘decisive & technically literate.’\n• Initiated complex laundering of vessel ownership while monitoring Alex’s networks to ensure non-interference, satisfied so far with her compliance.",
    "history": "Bishop first surfaced on Alex’s horizon as a name in a burned safe-house option; she remained an abstract potential client until the submarine request. Their inaugural call confirmed his preliminary assessment: ex-corp, resource-rich, disciplined. Since accepting the contract, Bishop has routed funds, forged shell companies, and arranged dockside modifications with zero hitches. Each fulfilled milestone moves Alex up his silent tier list—from unproven prospect to ‘trusted but watched,’ joining a scant roster of clients who grasp the stakes.",
