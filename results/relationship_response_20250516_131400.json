    "dynamic": "Alex views the sales associate as a pleasantly competent prop in her larger game of psychological brinkmanship with Emilia. His efficiency and composure amuse her, and she files him away as a low-stakes, high-utility asset who asks no awkward questions. In Alex’s world of high drama and shifting loyalties, his polite professionalism is almost relaxing—useful, forgettable, and therefore safe.",
    "recent_events": "During the Bougie Mall makeover, Alex flagged the associate down with a breezy ‘Which way to the ball gowns?’ and seamlessly folded him into her escalation against Emilia. His quick compliance and steady courtesy reinforced Alex’s sense that he can be relied upon for swift, discreet service in chaotic moments.",
    "history": "Their entire history is contained in one whirlwind shopping encounter: Alex noticed him mid-chaos (T+0 min), engaged him as logistical support (T+1 min), and confirmed his reliability when he guided the crew toward high-formality racks (T+3 min). No further contact has occurred, and Alex has not committed his name to memory.",

    "dynamic": "To the sales associate, Alex is the archetype of the high-energy power shopper—charismatic, slightly intimidating, and clearly in charge of a colorful entourage. He’s intrigued by her confidence and amused by the theatrical way she orchestrates her friends, but he maintains professional distance, channeling fascination into exemplary service. Beneath the polished smile is a hope that satisfying this client could translate into a memorable sale and a good story for later.",
    "recent_events": "Alex signaled him over with casual authority to locate ball gowns, instantly turning him into the linchpin of her grand reveal. He noticed the way the rest of the group deferred to her cues and adjusted his service tone accordingly, offering options and walking them toward the formal section while noting their eclectic energy.",
    "history": "The relationship began when Alex waved him down amid mall bustle; within moments he was guiding the party through tiers of lace, silhouettes, and satin (T+0–5 min). He observed Alex’s playful dominance over her companions and responded with heightened attentiveness, sensing both sales potential and theatrical flair. After completing his assistance, he resumed duties, cataloging the episode as the day’s standout encounter.",
