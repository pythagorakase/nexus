    "dynamic": "From Emilia’s vantage, Victor is an absence that still casts a long, bruising shadow. She carries equal measures of betrayal and reluctant concern: the man who saved her life also stole it, and every fresh rumor of his movements rips open that wound. Though she steels herself against him, a low-grade vigilance—part fear, part unresolved daughterly ache—keeps her listening for the next tremor of his reach.",
    "recent_events": "• Season 1: Alex’s intel briefing reveals Dynacorp is trying to ‘correct Emilia’s flaw,’ a reminder that Victor’s original violation is still echoing.\n• Season 1: A leaked shard confirms Victor is alive and asks Alex to ‘find the host,’ proving he is tracking her even in exile.\n• Seasons 3-5: Occasional sightings of Grey-Ghost operatives tailing Nexus shipments hint at his continued, unseen surveillance, reigniting Emilia’s anxiety and anger.",
    "history": "Childhood – Victor is a distant but doting corporate father, showering Emilia with opportunities while grooming her to inherit his legacy.\nDiagnosis – Her KADS prognosis pushes him into obsession; his tenderness curdles into control.\nEcho Procedure – Against her explicit refusal, he forges consent and uploads her, destroying her body and trust in one stroke.\nAftermath – Emilia awakens in a perfect host, traumatized; Victor vanishes amid Echo’s collapse, leaving only encrypted farewells.\nPresent – Years of silence harden into resentment. She joins Alex, becomes Nexus’s moral spine, yet Victor’s clandestine monitoring keeps the relationship in a state of suspended conflict.",

    "dynamic": "To Victor, Emilia is both lodestar and haunting: the single life he refused to lose and the living proof of his moral collapse. His love expresses itself as strategic guardianship from the shadows, convinced that one day she will appreciate the lengths he went to spare her death. Every new report of her growth within Nexus feeds a fierce pride laced with terror that she may condemn him beyond redemption.",

    "history": "Early Years – Victor nurtures Emilia’s brilliance, dreaming of a dynasty that unites his biotech empire with her promise.\nCrisis – Her incurable KADS diagnosis triggers his descent into forbidden science; he mortgaged career and conscience for a ‘perfect host’ protocol.\nThe Upload – Emilia’s refusal meets forged consent; he frames the act as paternal mercy, blind to the violation.\nFall & Flight – Echo collapses, Victor is scapegoated, and he vanishes to Okami with archive data, vowing to protect her from afar.\nOngoing – From exile he bankrolls labs, surveils her evolution, and plots a triumphant return where father and daughter can reunite on his rewritten terms, unaware that every silent gesture deepens the chasm he hopes to bridge.",
