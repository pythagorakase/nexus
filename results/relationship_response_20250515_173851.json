    "dynamic": "Alex views Raven as a sharp, adaptable broker who can be bargained with using wit as much as creds. The handshake deal for an undefined favor feels like both a victory and a lingering IOU, leaving Alex respectful yet watchful of how the ledger might be cashed. Beneath the sardonic banter she senses a useful, non-violent doorway into wider networks—and doorway means leverage. For now, curiosity and guarded goodwill outweigh risk.",
    "recent_events": "• Raven’s all-or-nothing opening gambit was defanged by Alex’s faux-perplexed questions, flipping control of the negotiation.\n• The pair agreed to exchange Echo leaks and survivor logs for a single future favor, formalized with a firm handshake.\n• Raven’s amused acceptance of Alex’s ‘Scary Spice’ codename created a small layer of personal rapport amid the professionalism.",
    "history": "First contact occurred during the Garden District café meet arranged through Alina. Raven opened with a pressure tactic, but Alex’s refusal to play by the script forced a shift to more collaborative terms. The successful trade, sealed by an open favor, established a nascent connective thread: Raven gained leverage, Alex gained intel and tested the broker’s flexibility. The relationship is only hours old, but has already moved from stranger to mutually intrigued associates.",

    "dynamic": "Raven finds Alex refreshingly unpredictable—an ex-corp survivor who dismantles leverage games with deadpan humor and still pays in something more valuable than money. The owed favor places Alex squarely in Raven’s ledger, turning a one-off sale into a budding strategic asset. She feels a genuine fondness for Alex’s ‘Scary Spice’ irreverence, even as she appraises how to deploy it. Patience and quiet calculation frame her intent to cultivate, not coerce.",
    "recent_events": "• Alex’s perplexed pushback forced Raven to pivot from an all-or-nothing offer to a single-favor arrangement, impressing her with the exec’s social engineering chops.\n• The favor handshake established a personal stake, confirming Raven’s long-game preference for access over immediate cash.\n• Raven’s amused acceptance of the Spice-Girl codenames added a sliver of camaraderie she rarely allows with clients.",
    "history": "Prior to the meet, Raven knew Alex only as Alina’s unpredictable teammate. During the café negotiation she tested Alex with a leverage probe, but Alex’s sideways approach revealed both backbone and creativity. Raven awarded both intel packages for an open favor, consciously investing in Alex as a medium-term asset. Departing the scene, she logged Alex under ‘valuable, lightly chaotic—monitor for opportunities,’ marking the transition from mere customer to friendly contact with leverage.",
