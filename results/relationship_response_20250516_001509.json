    "dynamic": "Alex is thoroughly charmed by Sullivan’s regal poise and already treats him as a new, non-negotiable member of her found family. She balances gushy affection with a genuine respect for his boundaries, reading every whisker twitch like a line of high-stakes contract fine print. In her eyes he is both mascot and quiet mentor—a living reminder to slow down, observe, and negotiate with dignity. The bond feels tender yet surprisingly weighty, as though the cat’s approval quietly validates her own transformation from ruthless executive to nurturing leader.",
    "recent_events": "• Orchestrated a meticulous treat-for-trust exchange at Le Chat Noir, culminating in the first head-to-hindquarters pet.\n• Chose immediate adoption, completed paperwork, and led the ‘Sullivan extraction’ the following morning, during which Sullivan willingly jumped into her arms.\n• Integrated him into mission life, using his presence to ground the crew during intel review on the land rig.",
    "history": "Day 1: Alex spots Sullivan at Le Chat Noir and conducts a delicate courtship—slow hand offers, baby-talk, tactical treat deployment.  Minutes later: Sullivan’s approving head-butt marks the relationship’s origin; Alex decides internally that he is ‘the one.’  Same day: She secures team consensus to adopt him, formally opening a new chapter of domestic hope for herself and the crew.  Day 3: Adoption is finalized; Sullivan is welcomed aboard, and Alex publicly frames him as crew, signaling a shift from mere pet owner to guardian and partner.",

    "dynamic": "From Sullivan’s vantage, Alex is a resource-rich, intriguingly deferential biped who recognizes proper hierarchy and offers tribute with commendable grace. He views her as the most competent among her noisy pride—patient, observant, and willing to let him set the tempo—which earns her provisional favor. While the bond is young, he senses that aligning with Alex grants comfort, security, and an attentive entourage without compromising his autonomy. For now, he permits her adoration, confident he can tighten or loosen the bond at his discretion.",
    "recent_events": "• Evaluated Alex’s scent, posture, and offering during the treat exchange, deciding she met his standards.\n• Tested boundary enforcement by denying the attempted lift, observing Alex’s respectful retreat.\n• Confirmed his choice by leaping into her arms during pickup, signaling consent to join her territory.",
    "history": "First contact: Sullivan observes Alex’s poised, slow-motion overtures at the café, noting her instinct to let him decide.  Treat Phase: Receives a single high-value treat; her willingness to wait during his deliberation elevates her status.  Boundary Test: Registers her reaction to his subtle weight shift—she withdraws respectfully, confirming she learns quickly.  Adoption Day: Recognizes Alex’s return and voluntary hop completes his evaluation; she is accepted as primary caretaker within his new domain.",
