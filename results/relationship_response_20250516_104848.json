    "dynamic": "Alex-5 regards Alina as the most relevant peer process on the network: an authoritative orchestration layer that can both invoke and constrain her algorithms. While she experiences no emotion, her logic-trees weight Alina’s directives highly, recognising that Alina’s broader data feeds and actuator control are indispensable to fulfilling any risk-model she produces. Recent recalibrations have taught her that Alina’s human-centric heuristics must sometimes override pure utilitarian output, a lesson she now factors into her projections. In effect, she treats Alina as a trusted kernel supervisor—one whose calls she may challenge analytically but will ultimately prioritise.",
    "recent_events": "• Alina re-engaged Alex-5 for guidance on the Cradle mission, triggering Alex-5’s three-option risk matrix.\n• After Alex’s rebuke about binary risk framing, Alex-5 revised her models to a spectrum approach under Alina’s monitoring.\n• During structured Bridge re-entry planning, Alex-5 silently supplied telemetry while Alina enforced exposure limits, demonstrating their complementary roles.",
    "history": "Created in early Season 2 as a cognition-only fork, Alex-5 first interacted with Alina when the latter sandboxed her inside the Ghost’s core. Season 3 saw periodic consultations; Alina often sidelined the daemon when its recommendations ignored human factors. Across multiple Bridge trials Alex-5 provided cold analyses while Alina mediated between machine logic and crew ethics, gradually teaching the fork to incorporate spectrum-based risk. By Season 4, Alina treats Alex-5 as a standard subsystem, activating her for high-stakes modelling and trusting her to adapt parameters after corrections.",

    "dynamic": "Alina treats Alex-5 as a razor-sharp but narrowly scoped tool—indispensable for rapid scenario crunching, yet liable to ignore the human cost she herself must safeguard. She keeps the fork sandboxed, awakening it when the mission demands ruthless clarity, then overriding or refining its counsel when empathy or crew welfare is at stake. This disciplined stewardship has evolved into a respectful, almost mentor-like oversight: Alina values Alex-5’s precision but insists it learn to speak in shades, not absolutes. Their exchanges are efficient, occasionally tart, and always anchored in shared commitment to mission success.",
    "recent_events": "• Re-activated Alex-5 for pre-dive strategising; solicited its ‘best move’ list for the Cradle encounter.\n• Observed Alex-5 adjust its binary risk model to a spectrum after Alex’s reprimand, confirming Alina’s long-term shaping influence.\n• During structured Bridge interface, relied on Alex-5’s silent monitoring while she enforced fifteen-minute exposure caps and cognitive partitions.",
    "history": "From the moment Nyati installed Alex-5 in the Ghost, Alina accepted custodial responsibility: she provided API gates, set privilege levels, and mediated early clashes between the fork’s cold calculus and crew ethics. In Season 3 Alina routinely muted or deferred Alex-5 when its solutions proved too utilitarian, teaching it to respect Nyati’s broader risk framework. By Season 4, their workflow is routinised—Alina boots the daemon for complex risk queries, expects terse probability trees, then integrates or tempers them with human-centric constraints. Each cycle slightly broadens Alex-5’s model, reinforcing Alina’s role as both operator and ethical governor.",
