Prompt for Cursor:

Step 1: Review & Analyze:
	•	Carefully review the provided /README.md from my existing Nexus project.
	•	Thoroughly review the /letta subdirectory as the new proposed foundation.

Prompt Objective:
Your task is to help me start fresh by leveraging Letta as a clean foundation.
After reviewing both the existing project goals (from README.md) and the Letta codebase, provide:
	•	A detailed roadmap, clearly structured as a sequential list, outlining:
	1.	How Letta can be used as foundational building blocks (mention specific modules/components from Letta).
	2.	Which aspects of my original Nexus design need to be rebuilt or adapted on top of Letta.
	3.	A clear, prioritized sequence of necessary additions or modifications, including where Letta’s default functionality falls short of my specific goals and must be expanded or adapted.
	4.	For each roadmap step, briefly indicate:
	•	The nature of work required (integration, new feature, adaptation).
	•	Why this step is necessary relative to my project’s stated goals.
	•	Dependencies on prior steps in the roadmap.

Your analysis should assume the Letta repository is the new starting point, completely replacing existing infrastructure where appropriate, but clearly flag areas where critical elements of the existing “Night City Stories” architecture would need to be ported or recreated.

Please prioritize clarity, precision, and actionable specificity.
