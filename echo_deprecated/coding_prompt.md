# Handoff Prompt for Cursor Assistant

I'm working on a script to flatten a hierarchical JSON dataset for fine-tuning a BGE-Small embedding model. The dataset contains character information, relationships, locations, and concepts from a cyberpunk narrative world.

## Dataset Structure
- JSON with top-level categories (characters, relationships, locations, concepts)
- Each category contains entities (e.g., characters like "Alex", "Emilia")
- Entities may have direct queries or nested subcategories
- Some entities have "aliases" arrays that should be skipped
- Each query has multiple "positive" and "negative" examples

## Current Issue
I've attempted to write a flattening script that should generate triplets (query, positive, negative) for every combination, but it's only producing a small subset of the expected output. With 144 queries, 185 positives, and 304 negatives, we should get many more combinations.

## Sample Script
```python
import json
import os
from itertools import product
from collections import defaultdict

def flatten_dataset(input_file, output_file):
    # ... [code as shown above]
```

## Debugging Goals
1. Identify why the script isn't processing all entries
2. Fix the nested structure handling to correctly identify all queries
3. Make sure aliases arrays are properly skipped
4. Generate all valid combinations of query-positive-negative triplets
5. Output detailed statistics to verify data coverage

Can you help me debug this script to correctly extract all training examples from my dataset?
