          <p>The old lighthouse keeper had warned them about the fog. Not the ordinary kind that rolled in from the sea each evening, predictable as clockwork—but the <em>other</em> fog, the one that came maybe once a decade, thick and strange, carrying with it the scent of things that shouldn't be.</p>
          <p>"When you can't see your hand in front of your face," he'd said, tapping ash from his pipe, "that's when you stay inside. Lock the doors. Don't answer if someone knocks." His eyes had gone distant then, looking at something none of them could see. "Especially if you recognize the voice."</p>
          <p>Sarah had laughed it off at the time. Ghost stories, she'd thought. The ramblings of a man who'd spent too many years alone with the waves. But now, standing on the deck of the research vessel with visibility down to maybe three feet, she wasn't laughing anymore.</p>
          <p>Something was moving in the fog. She couldn't quite see it—just the suggestion of movement, a darker smudge against the gray. It seemed to be keeping pace with the boat, staying just at the edge of visibility.</p>
