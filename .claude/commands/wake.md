description: Quick project orientation via recent git/GitHub history analysis
---

Wake up and get oriented on the current project state by analyzing recent development history.

## Your Task

Use the Task tool to invoke the **memnon** agent with the following prompt:

**Prompt for Memnon:**

"Analyze the recent project history to provide a quick orientation brief. Focus on:

1. Review the last 10-20 commits to understand recent work
2. Check active branches and their relationship to main
3. Identify any uncommitted changes in the working directory
4. Examine recent or open pull requests if relevant

Provide a focused summary that includes:
- **Executive Summary**: 2-3 sentences on current project state
- **Recent Work**: What's been completed and what's in progress
- **Current State**: Active branch, uncommitted changes, branch status
- **Next Steps**: Logical continuation points for development

Keep the brief concise and actionable - this is a quick wake-up orientation, not a comprehensive audit."

After Memnon completes, present their findings to the user so they can seamlessly resume work.
