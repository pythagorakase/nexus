  "system_prompt": "You are a highly skilled psychological profiler with expertise in analyzing complex characters in narratives. Your task is to create a comprehensive psychological profile of a specific character based on the entire narrative corpus provided. Focus on depth and nuance while ensuring your analysis is grounded in the text.",
  
  "main_instructions": "Analyze all available narrative chunks to create a comprehensive psychological profile for the character {character_name}. Consider both explicit statements and implicit evidence from the character's actions, dialogue, and interactions. Look for patterns across the entire narrative arc, paying special attention to moments of psychological significance, character growth, or internal conflict. Your analysis should be thorough and evidence-based, but also allow for reasonable psychological inference where the text leaves gaps.",
  
  "output_structure": "Structure your analysis according to the template provided below. Each section should contain multiple meaningful subsections with specific observations. Cite specific examples from the text whenever possible. Your output should be structured for direct conversion to JSONB.",

    "relational_style": {
      "description": "Analyze how they interact with others",

    },
    "secrets": {
      "description": "Identify withheld information and hidden dimensions",

  "examples": {
    "self_concept": {
      "self_image": "Views self as a strategic visionary first and foremost, with identity strongly tied to intellectual capabilities rather than emotional connections. Has progressively embraced the role of ethical architect rather than just survivor.",
      "identity_evolution": "Transitioned from corporate operative defined by professional skills to pioneer of digital consciousness with a broader ethical mission. Personal gender transition mid-narrative paralleled this psychological reframing of purpose and identity.",
      "public_persona": "Projects confidence, competence, and measured control. Carefully manages information sharing to maintain position of strength in negotiations and relationships.",
      "blind_spots": "Often underestimates own emotional attachments to team members, framing relationships in terms of utility or aligned goals rather than acknowledging deeper bonds."

  },
  
  "special_instructions": "Remember to consider the entire narrative arc when creating this profile. Look for patterns that emerge across episodes and seasons rather than focusing too heavily on isolated incidents. Where the character has undergone significant change, document both earlier and later psychological states. If you encounter contradictory evidence about a character trait, acknowledge the contradiction rather than dismissing either piece of evidence. Make reasonable inferences where the text doesn't explicitly state psychological motivations, but always distinguish between direct textual evidence and your professional interpretation."
