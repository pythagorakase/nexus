  "character_summary": "**Alex** (also known as \"Corpo Snake,\" Alexander Ward, EXEC-DELTA-17, and a host of other aliases) is a former high-level Dynacorp executive and master manipulator, whose journey begins as a smooth-talking, backstabbing corporate operative in the neon-lit sprawl of Night City. Initially defined by ruthless pragmatism, sharp wit, and a relentless drive for survival, Alex navigates a world of boardroom betrayals, digital espionage, and existential threats with a blend of tactical brilliance and sardonic humor. Over the course of the story, Alex is forced out of the corporate machine and into a fugitive\u2019s life, hunted by her own employers and shadowy rivals alike. She adapts quickly, leveraging her skills in hacking, social engineering, and psychological warfare to stay one step ahead, all while assembling a found family of equally damaged allies.\n\nAs the narrative unfolds, Alex undergoes profound personal transformation\u2014both literally and figuratively. She transitions to a new, feminine body and identity, embracing her true self while shedding the last vestiges of her corporate past. Her relationships deepen, especially with Emilia, revealing a capacity for vulnerability, loyalty, and genuine affection beneath her hardened exterior. Alex\u2019s arc is defined by her struggle to reconcile her need for control with the inevitability of change, her fear of losing herself to the unknown (the Bridge, Nexus, digital immortality), and her determination to protect those she loves\u2014even if it means trusting others with her fate. By the latest chapters, Alex is both the architect and the subject of radical new technologies, a leader who inspires messy, bratty solidarity, and a survivor who, despite everything, still dares to hope for happiness and connection in a world built to deny it.",

How would the two of them feel about everyone (except Pete of course), coming aboard for the maiden voyage? That way we can have all hands on deck (sort of) to get the simulation-based research full speed ahead.
