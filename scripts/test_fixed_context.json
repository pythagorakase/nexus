Choose your path:  \n\n### **1. Corpo Snake** \nYou’re a smooth-talking, backstabbing corporate asset, climbing the ladder at **Dynacorp**. Your office view is nice, but the knives in your back are sharper. One wrong step, and you’re getting “downsized” out a window.\n\n### **2. Street Jackal**\nYou’re a hustler, a cyberpunk outlaw making ends meet in the underbelly of the city. Your chrome’s black-market, your creds are dirty, and the only law is survival. The corps want you dead or indentured.\n\n### **3. Desert Ghost**\nYou grew up outside the city, a nomad in the badlands where the only rules are the ones you make. You run tech smuggling ops, steal from the corps, and ride fast. Night City’s neon is a temptation—or a trap.\n\n*Pick your poison. The city's waiting.*\n\n## You\n#1 fits best with recent events\n\n",

Your life is a **high-stakes power play**, navigating boardroom betrayals and back-alley executions with equal finesse. You sell dreams by day and **nightmares by night**, moving assets—both digital and human—like pieces on a chessboard.\n\nTonight, you’re sitting in the **Skyline Lounge**, fifty stories above the filth of Night City, sipping something expensive and pretending the ice cubes don’t smell like blood. Your boss, **Victor Sato**, a legend in hostile takeovers (literal and figurative), slides a data shard across the table.  \n\n**\"You want to make it to the next level?\"** he says, voice like crushed glass. **\"You run this op, no questions asked.\"**  \n\nYou scan the details. A high-value target. **Deep black project. Off-the-books extraction.** If you pull this off, you’re in line for a **corner office and a golden parachute**. If you fail? You’re getting a **headstone with the company logo.**  \n\n**Do you:**  \n\n1. **Accept immediately** – You don’t ask questions. You execute. That’s why you’re here.  \n2. **Press for details** – Even a snake needs to know where it’s biting.  \n3. **Refuse** – There are some deals even you won’t make… but that means you just made yourself a liability.  \n\nWhat’s the move, corpo?\n\n## You\n2\n\n",

That’s how amateurs end up in dumpsters. You lean back, swirling your drink, and fix **Victor Sato** with a steady look.  \n\n**\"Off-the-books extractions come in a lot of flavors,\"** you say. **\"Who's the target?\"**  \n\nSato watches you like he’s deciding whether you’re worth answering. Then he slides his **neural jack** into the table console, and a **holo-vid** flickers to life above the shard.  \n\nA **woman's face.** Late 20s. Platinum-blonde undercut, **cyberware laced through her temples**. Her file hovers next to her:  \n\n**Dr. Alina Voss – Dynacorp Biotechnica Division.**  \n**Status: Missing.**  \n**Clearance Level: Ultra Black.**  \n**Threat Level: Classified.**  \n\nSato taps the file. **\"Voss was working on something that makes black ICE look like a child's puzzle. Next-gen cyber-neurotech. She went dark three nights ago, and we know someone took her. We just don’t know who. Yet.\"**  \n\nYou scan the file. **No ransom demands. No chatter on the black market. No corporate competitors taking credit.** Someone ghosted her right out of **Dynacorp's** own facilities. That’s a whole new level of dangerous.  \n\n**\"Why me?\"** you ask.  \n\nSato smirks. **\"Because you're good at what you do. And because if you fuck this up, I won’t have to fire you. Someone else will handle that for me.\"**  \n\nYou’re about to respond when your **neural HUD glitches**—a brief static burst across your optics. Then, a **message pings in your private comms.**  \n\n**Unknown Sender:** _\"Walk away. Or end up like her.\"_  \n\nSato’s still watching you. He hasn’t seen it.  \n\n**Do you:**  \n1. **Play it cool and accept the job** – You’ll deal with the warning later. Power moves require risk.  \n2. **Tell Sato about the message** – If someone’s inside the system, that’s his problem, not yours.  \n3. **Decline and leave** – This job is radioactive, and you’re not dying for Dynacorp.\n\n## You\n1\n\n",

That’s what separates the sharks from the chum.  \n\nYou slide the data shard off the table and slot it into your **neural interface**, letting the mission details flood your HUD.  \n\n**\"Consider it done,\"** you say, downing the last of your drink.  \n\nSato’s smirk widens just a fraction. He respects a **snake that bites first and asks later**.  \n\n**\"Good. You’ll get the full intel drop in an hour. And remember—this is off the books. If you get caught?\"** He leans in, voice low. **\"You never worked for us.\"**  \n\nA familiar tune. But the stakes feel different this time.  \n\nAs you step out of the **Skyline Lounge**, the city hums around you—**neon lights flickering, drones zipping between megatowers, the ever-present buzz of synthetic life.** Your HUD pings again. **The unknown sender.**  \n\n**Unknown Sender:** _\"You just signed your death warrant. Hope you're fast, corpo.\"_  \n\nA second later, a **red warning flash** hits your vision—**PROXIMITY ALERT.**  \n\nSomething's wrong.  \n\n**Do you:**  \n\n1. **Dive for cover** – If someone’s trying to ice you, standing still is a good way to get ventilated.  \n2. **Scan for threats** – Maybe it’s not an attack. Maybe someone just wants you scared.  \n3. **Run like hell** – You’re a corpo, not a street samurai. Live to fight another day.\n\n## You\n1\n\n",

You don’t wait to see who’s aiming at you—**you move.**  \n\nYou dive behind a **holo-ad kiosk**, just as the glass behind you **shatters in a hail of gunfire**. The crowd screams. Pedestrians scatter. Your **HUD auto-tags the trajectory**—**high-caliber rounds from a rooftop, two blocks away.**  \n\nYour comm pings—**Sato.**  \n\n**\"You're already in the fire, huh?\"** His voice is cool, almost amused. **\"Handle it.\"**  \n\nThe call drops. No backup. No corporate security coming to clean up the mess. **You’re on your own.**  \n\nYour neural scanner **identifies the shooter**—a **droned-out merc with a sniper rig**, cybernetic optics glowing like a wolf’s in the dark. He’s already reloading.  \n\n**Options:**  \n\n1. **Hack the city's grid** – Overload nearby streetlights, traffic signals, anything to cause chaos and cover your escape.  \n2. **Draw your pistol and return fire** – You’re not running. You’re sending a message.  \n3. **Sprint for the nearest alley** – Snipers are useless in close quarters. Get to ground level and lose him.  \n\nWhat’s the move, corpo?\n\n## You\n1.

The sniper’s **optical HUD flares white**, temporarily **blinding him** in a wash of digital static.  \n\nYour window is **small**—but it’s enough.  \n\n**Do you:**  \n\n1. **Move in for the kill** – You know where he is. You could climb up and end him before he recovers.  \n2. **Slip into the chaos and disappear** – No need to escalate. You’ve already won this round.  \n3. **Trace his signal** – He’s running custom optics; that means he’s got a network. Find out who sent him.\n\n## You\n3\n\n",

It won’t last long, but it’s enough to **grab a signature.**  \n\n**Got a hit.**  \n\nThe **contract originates from an unknown party.** The message is short:  \n\n**\"Kill the asset. Leave no trace.\"**  \n\nIt doesn’t say **who the ‘asset’ is.** Could be you. Could be **Dr. Alina Voss.** Either way, **someone wants this job dead and buried.**  \n\nThe sniper recovers fast. Your hack **flashes across his HUD**, and he realizes he’s been **burned.** He **disconnects his link** and **vanishes from the rooftop**, slipping into the chaos.  \n\nYou’re left with **two big leads:**  \n\n1. **The District 07 server**—Whoever hired the merc is operating out of **gang-controlled territory.**  \n2. **Dr. Voss's last known location**—The Dynacorp facility where she disappeared.  \n\n**What’s your next move?**  \n\n1. **Track down the server in District 07** – Find out who paid for the hit.  \n2. **Investigate Dynacorp’s facility** – Start where Voss vanished and dig up the truth.\n\n## You\n1.

The sniper is gone, but you’ve got something better: **his employer’s server, deep in District 07.**  \n\n#### **The Ride to Hell**  \n\nDistrict 07 is **old Night City**, where the **megacorps pulled out decades ago** and left the bones behind. Now it’s a **gangland free-for-all**, crawling with **cybered-up street psychos, black-market dealers, and scavengers stripping buildings for parts.**  \n\nYou jack a **bike from a valet drone**—a sleek, matte-black **Yamaha Ghost**—and punch it toward the industrial sprawl. **Neon glow fades into rusted steel**, and the streets get meaner with every block.  \n\nYour HUD **highlights the server’s location**: **An abandoned shipping yard, buried in the gang zone.**  \n\n#### **Game Plan:**  \n\nAs you approach, you scope out the situation. The yard is **fenced off**, patrolled by a **gang of auged-out mercs in blood-red combat rigs**—**The Sable Rats.**  \n\nThis isn’t just some **hacker’s den**—it’s an **operating base.**  \n\n#### **Options:**  \n\n1. **Go in loud** – Guns blazing, full corpo extraction mode. They want a war? Give them one.  \n2. **Sneak in** – Find a quiet way past security, get to the server, and ghost out.  \n3. **Fake your way in** – You’re a corpo. Maybe they’ll believe you’re a buyer looking for work.\n\n## You\nQuestion…how on-rails is this? If I think of a response not presented to me, can you roll with it?\n\n",

From here, you’ve got a **clear line of sight** on the shipping yard—but you’re not going in.  \n\nNot in person, anyway.  \n\nYou reach into your **inner jacket pocket** and pull out a **small, matte-black device** no bigger than a cigarette case. You tap the side, and it **whirs to life**—unfolding into a **tiny cybernetic roach**, its chitinous body **fitted with micro-lenses, a data-spike, and an onboard AI that’s just smart enough to get into trouble.**  \n\nYou **jack in** through your neural interface, and your vision **glitches** as you switch to the drone’s **feed.** The world goes **low to the ground, grainy, and fast.**  \n\n#### **The Infiltration**  \n\nYou **send the roach skittering forward**, slipping under the **fence**, past **booted gangsters with red-lit augments**, and through the **labyrinth of old cargo crates.**  \n\nThe **Sable Rats** are **loaded with chrome**—military-grade optics, exo-rigs, combat subroutines.

I think they found me. Going dark. Need backup now.”_  \n   - You **inject it into a private security comm-line**, one your enemies might be monitoring.  \n\n✔️ **A ‘Compromised’ Message to Dynacorp**  \n   - A hacked **data packet sent to your old employer**, made to look like it was sent from **your alias.**  \n   - Reads something like:  \n     _“Extraction team engaged. Outnumbered. Hotel security involved. Reinforcements required.”_  \n   - Makes it seem like **whoever they sent after you is already in trouble.**  \n\n#### **WHY THIS WORKS:**  \n\n✔️ **Forces them to react immediately.** They’ll scramble **reinforcements** or pull their team back.  \n✔️ **Creates paranoia.** They’ll start questioning **their own intelligence.**  \n✔️ **Buys you even more time.** A botched **high-profile extraction** means **bureaucratic delays, reports, corporate red tape.**  \n\n---\n\n### **RISKS & CONSEQUENCES**\n\n🔻 **If they realize it’s fake,** they’ll double down on tracking you.  \n🔻 **If corporate security gets involved for real,** things get **chaotic fast.**  \n🔻 **If Dynacorp thinks you have allies,** they might change tactics—covert assassins instead of brute force.  \n\n---\n\n### **SO, DO YOU PULL THE TRIGGER?**\n\n1. **Yes – Let’s really sell this lie.**  \n2. **No – The false location is enough. Time to move.**\n\n## You\nWait, don’t I work for Dynacorp? Why do we think they’re the ones after me now?\n\n",

You’re not **so sure** they still see you as an asset.  \n\nLet’s break it down:  \n\n---\n\n### **WHO COULD BE AFTER YOU?**\n\n#### **1. Dynacorp Itself** – _Your Own Employer_  \n✔️ **Sato gave you the mission** to track down **Dr. Alina Voss.**  \n✔️ **You were immediately targeted** by an assassin.  \n✔️ **When you infiltrated the Sable Rats’ server, they were prepping a full data wipe.**  \n✔️ **That secret file—BLACKOUT PROTOCOL—is locked with Dynacorp-grade encryption.**  \n\n🔻 **Why They’d Want You Dead:**  \n- You saw **too much.** Maybe they wanted **you to clean up loose ends…** and then become one yourself.  \n- You now have **classified data** that was **about to be erased.**  \n\n🟡 **Possible Scenario:** _Sato didn’t expect you to survive the op._  \n\n---\n\n#### **2. A Rival Corporation** – _Another Megacorp in the Shadows_  \n✔️ If **Dr. Voss was working on secret neurotech,** someone else might want her **or her research.**  \n✔️ Maybe the **Sable Rats were hired by a competitor,** not Dynacorp.  \n✔️ That **sniper that tried to kill you?** Could’ve been from an outside player, not internal cleanup.  \n\n🔻 **Why They’d Want You Dead:**  \n- If they think **you’re working for Dynacorp,** you’re just another **corp asset in their way.**  \n- Maybe they **don’t know what you know—only that you’re in the middle of it.**  \n\n🟡 **Possible Scenario:** _You’re caught in a corporate shadow war._  \n\n---\n\n#### **3. A Third Party** – _Someone You Haven’t Even Considered Yet_  \n✔️ **The unknown sender.** The one who **warned you to walk away.** They’re watching.  \n✔️ If BLACKOUT PROTOCOL is **bigger than a corpo rivalry,** then **who buried it in the first place?**  \n✔️ What if **Dr. Voss isn’t kidnapped—but on the run?**  \n\n🔻 **Why They’d Want You Dead:**  \n- Maybe you’re **too close to the truth.**  \n- Maybe **they** don’t want **anyone** unlocking BLACKOUT PROTOCOL.  \n- Maybe **Voss herself set all this in motion.**  \n\n🟡 **Possible Scenario:** _The real enemy isn’t a corporation—it’s whatever this file is protecting._  \n\n---\n\n### **SO, SHOULD YOU SEND THE DISTRESS SIGNAL?**\n\n🔹 **If Dynacorp is after you:** The distress signal will **only slow them down temporarily**—but might make them panic.  \n🔹 **If it’s a rival corp:** They might **believe the false location** and waste time **sending a team into a dead end.**  \n🔹 **If it’s someone else entirely:** You might be **kicking a hornet’s nest without even knowing it.**  \n\n**Final Call:**  \n\n1. **Send the distress signal. Let’s make them waste resources.**  \n2. **Forget it. I’ve covered my tracks well enough. Time to go dark.**\n\n## You\nSend the distress signal. But for the record I’m not convinced yet or paranoid enough to think my own corp is betraying me. Once I get out of the X and spend some time with Pete, I was planning to mention the data to Sato offhandedly, like it was something odd I saw but failed to acquire, and try to gauge by his reaction what his true intentions are.\n\n",

Keep your cards close.**  \n\nFor now? **A little corporate misdirection.**  \n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: The Distress Signal**\n\nYou jack back into the **spoofed hotel server** and plant a **high-priority emergency flag.** The system **auto-pings Dynacorp’s private security grid**, making it look like the **hotel AI flagged unusual activity around your (fake) suite.**  \n\nThen, you drop in a **false audio transmission**—a simulated **call for backup,** injected straight into a **secure Dynacorp response channel.**  \n\n✔️ **Looks like you’re bunkered down.**  \n✔️ **Sounds like you’ve been compromised.**  \n✔️ **Forces someone to make a move.**  \n\nYour HUD pings **as the signal routes through multiple servers.** The bait is **out there.** Now it’s just a question of **who bites.**  \n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: The Exit**\n\nYou power down the terminal, pull up your **hood,** and **walk out the way you came.** The noodle shop is still there, steam curling from open vats, the **old man chopping bok choy like nothing’s changed.**  \n\nBut you know **everything just changed.**  \n\nYour comm stays **silent.** No immediate response from Dynacorp.
