All unauthorized vehicles will be—\"**  \n\nYou kill the feed. **Wrong corps, wrong battlefield.** The past **lingers** out here, but you’ve got bigger problems.  \n\n---\n\n### **THE RENDEZVOUS**\n\nNo-Name Pete’s **coordinates** take you into an **abandoned missile silo**, buried deep in the desert. You follow an old **cracked service road**, headlights catching flashes of **old-world military wreckage—burned-out tanks, shredded VTOL husks, minefields that may or may not be dead.**  \n\nFinally, you hit **a chain-link gate**, reinforced with **rusted plating and solar panels.** The **sign on the fence is hand-painted, in red:**  \n\n**“NOTHING WORTH DYING FOR PAST THIS POINT.”**  \n\nYou cut the engine. The silence is **absolute.** Just the distant hum of **wind turbines** and the occasional **animal scream from somewhere too far to matter.**  \n\nThen—**movement.**  \n\nA turret **deploys from the sand**, old but **functional.** You hear **servo motors whine**, adjusting its aim **right at your head.**  \n\nThen, a **voice from the intercom:**  \n\n**\"If you're selling something, I don't want it. If you're lost, you're already dead. And if you're Corpo, you can fuck off right now.\"**  \n\nThat’s gotta be Pete.  \n\n**What’s your approach?**  \n\n1. **Go full tech-nerd.** You’ve got his cyberdeck, talk like you’re a fellow enthusiast.  \n2. **Be direct.** You have something he’ll want to see, and time is running out.  \n3. **Throw him off.** Tell him Dynacorp is already onto him—paranoia might make him listen.\n\n## You\nDoesn’t he know me? “Hey, it’s just me! You didn’t recognize me in my cool new nullcloak. I brought you a preeeeesent!” I slowly pull out the vintage deck.\n\n",
                "34": "<!-- SCENE BREAK: S01E02_002 (storyteller heading) -->\n## Storyteller\n### **CORPO SNAKE – FRIENDLY DELIVERY SERVICE**\n\nYou **tilt your head up toward the intercom**, keeping your hands **calm and visible.**  \n\n**\"Damn, Pete. You didn't recognize me? Guess this new cloak really works.\"**  \n\nSilence. The turret **whines**, tracking a slow **circle around your head.**  \n\nThen—**a sharp beep.** The turret **powers down**.  \n\nThe intercom **crackles** again.  \n\n**\"Hah! You slick bastard. Almost shot you in the face.\"**  \n\nThere’s a **grinding sound** as the **gate unlocks**, the rusty chain mechanism straining but **holding together.** The fencing slides open just enough for your **bike to slip through.**  \n\nAs you push inside, you hold up the **Kiroshi K-512,** letting it **catch the moonlight.**  \n\n**\"Brought you a present.\"**  \n\nAnother pause. Then a sharp, **short burst of laughter.**  \n\n**\"Holy shit. Is that what I think it is?\"**  \n\nThe **silo doors hiss open**, steam venting from **hidden hydraulics**, revealing a **stairwell leading down.**  \n\n**\"Well, don’t just stand there looking pretty. Get the hell inside before something eats you.\"**  \n\n---\n\n### **THE DESCENT**\n\nInside, **Pete’s lair** is a **maze of tangled cables, blinking servers, and cybernetic scrap fused into the walls.** The **air is thick with machine oil, burnt wiring, and coffee strong enough to qualify as a controlled substance.**  \n\nNo-Name Pete himself?  \n\n✔️ **Unshaven, hair shaved close except for a hacked-together neural crown** fused into his skull.  \n✔️ **Black-market cybernetics bolted directly into his forearms**, no synthetic skin to hide the ugly truth.  \n✔️ **Baggy cargo pants, a ratty \"I SURVIVED THE COLLAPSE\" hoodie, and a pair of broken glasses he doesn’t even need.**  \n\nHe **snatches the K-512 from your hands**, eyes **gleaming with something between love and madness.**  \n\n**\"Ohhhh, this is clean. This is *so* clean. Where the hell did you find it?\"**  \n\nYou smirk. **\"I have my ways.\"**  \n\nHe spins it in his hands, **admiring every detail.** Then, finally, he snaps his **cyber-optics up to you.**  \n\n**\"Alright. You got me interested. What the hell do you need cracked?\"**  \n\n---\n\n### **THE ASK**\n\nYou slide out the **data shard** with **BLACKOUT PROTOCOL**, tossing it between your fingers before handing it over.  \n\n**\"This.\"**  \n\nPete doesn’t take it immediately. He just **stares at it.**  \n\nThen, he **smirks.**  \n\n**\"You have no idea what’s on this, do you?\"**  \n\nThat *stings*—but you just shrug. **\"I figured you’d be the one to tell me.\"**  \n\nPete **snatches the shard, flips it between his fingers, then slots it into his terminal.** The **K-512 hums to life, its old circuits thrumming.**  \n\nHe cracks his **knuckles**, flexes his **augmented hands**, and rolls his shoulders.  \n\n**\"Alright, corpo. Let’s see what kind of trouble you just brought to my doorstep.\"**  \n\n---\n\n### **DECRYPTION BEGINS…**\n\nNow the **real game starts.**  \n\n1. **Stay and watch.** You need to see what’s inside that file.  \n2. **Secure the perimeter.** If someone followed you, Pete’s not ready for a fight.  \n3. **Make contact with Sato.** Time to see if your boss reacts to the mention of BLACKOUT PROTOCOL.\n\n## You\n1. Pete’s perimeter seems secure enough with the cameras and turrets. And I’ll call Sato later. It might make Pete nervous and I came here to be off the grid, not chat on the phone.\n\n",
                "35": "<!-- SCENE BREAK: S01E02_003 (storyteller heading) -->\n## Storyteller\n### **CORPO SNAKE – OPENING PANDORA’S BOX**\n\nYou **stay put,** arms crossed, watching as Pete gets to work.  \n\nThe **old cyberdeck hums**, its outdated processors **grinding through the encryption**, line by line, layer by layer. You can hear the **soft click-click-click** of Pete’s **neural implants cycling through algorithms**, his fingers twitching with **subconscious micro-commands.**  \n\nFor the first few minutes, it’s **routine.**  \n\nThen? **Something changes.**  \n\n---\n\n### **THE GLITCH**\n\nThe **screen flickers.**  \n\nNot like a **normal data corruption.** Not like a **bad sector or an outdated codec.**  \n\nThis is **different.**  \n\nThe screen **warps**—stretches—then **snaps back.** The text is still there, but now it’s **wrong.**  \n\nLines of code are **rewriting themselves**, shifting in real-time, like **something inside the file is alive.**  \n\nPete **flinches**, his cybernetic fingers **seizing up for half a second** before he **grits his teeth and pushes through.**  \n\n**\"That’s... not normal.\"** His voice is flat, but his eyes? **Pure adrenaline.**  \n\n---\n\n### **WHAT YOU SEE**\n\nThe **first real decryption results** start scrolling across the monitor:  \n\n✔️ **PROJECT BLACKOUT** – *Dynacorp Neurotech Division*  \n✔️ **Subject: [REDACTED]**  \n✔️ **Directive: [REDACTED]**  \n✔️ **Test Site: [REDACTED]**  \n\nEverything important? **Scrubbed.** But the deeper Pete digs, the more he **uncovers fragments.**  \n\nThen, one **partially recovered phrase stands out among the noise:**  \n\n**“…SELF-PROPOGATING NEUROALGORITHMIC ENTITY…”**  \n\nYou don’t like the sound of that.  \n\nNeither does Pete.  \n\nHe **snaps the cyberdeck shut** so fast the **monitor sparks.**  \n\n**\"Nope.\"** He shakes his head, standing up. **\"No. Fuck you. I don’t want anything to do with this.\"**  \n\n**\"What?\"** You frown. **\"What the hell is a self-propagating neuro—whatever?\"**  \n\nPete rubs his **temples**, muttering something in **broken Net-slang.** Finally, he exhales, looking you dead in the eye.  \n\n**\"It means this isn’t just data. This file isn’t *passive.* It’s not just information sitting on a shard somewhere. It’s...\"** He hesitates. **\"...a *mind.*\"**  \n\nA **long silence.**  \n\nThe terminal **flickers again**, as if to **remind you it’s still listening.**  \n\n**\"You brought me a fucking *brain virus,* corpo.\"**  \n\n---\n\n### **WHAT NOW?**\n\n1. **Push Pete to keep digging.** If this thing is alive, what the hell was Dynacorp doing with it?  \n2. **Eject the shard immediately.** If Pete’s spooked, maybe you should be too.  \n3. **Ask what the worst-case scenario is.** What happens if this thing isn’t contained?\n\n## You\n1. If anyone can safely handle something like this, it’s him. Plus, you mentioned as one of the potential gifts a snipped or “rogue AI code” or some such. He might be unnerved, but he’s too curious to back out of this.\n\n"
