            "summary": "Dr. Kamara Nyati—“Posh Spice” to the crew, “Jobbing Captain” whenever Alex forgets to lead—serves as Nexus’s chief neuroscientist, ethical backbone, and reluctant authority figure. Born in Lagos shortly before the post-Collapse turmoil, she emigrated with her biomedical-engineer parents to New Houston, where scarcity, parental rigor, and her own prodigious intellect forged a relentless drive for precision and accountability. By twenty-five she held a doctorate in neurocybernetics and had been recruited into Dynacorp’s black-sector Echo program. There she refined mind-mapping algorithms and neural-coherence routines meant to make consciousness transfer scalable, yet clashed constantly with superiors over autonomy and consent. \n\nNyati mentored Emilia at Dynacorp Neurotech, quietly shielding her from corporate harm as best she could. Losing Emilia to Echo was a personal and professional wound—her first true failure of ethics and mentorship. Reuniting with Emilia post-rescue to lead Nexus research is a bittersweet redemption opportunity.\n\nShe secretly maintained covert, unauthorized backchannels with Alina Voss during her captivity, providing small stability patches and critical moral support. Her understated rapport with Alina reflects a history neither openly acknowledges.\n\nShe authored the theoretical core (\"Nyati Coherence Matrix\") behind full-fidelity mind transfers used successfully only once—Emilia's upload. Dynacorp's proprietary \"secret sauce\" was withheld from her, leaving Nyati to painstakingly reconstruct critical missing elements post-escape. Her intuitive breakthroughs under pressure (as dramatically demonstrated during the \"Eureka\" episode) reflect both her brilliance and her ongoing struggle to fill in these crucial gaps.\n\nWitnessing half-erased uploads, memory pruning, and living “failures,” she sabotaged portions of her own codebase, then vanished off-grid when the project heads prepared to silence her. Alex’s crew extracted her from a Dynacorp blacksite scheduled for her “correction,” and Nyati—exhausted, furious, but still brilliant—reluctantly accepted the role of lead scientist for Nexus, vowing never again to let research hurt those who cannot consent.\n\nIntellectually incisive and chronically over-caffeinated, Nyati oscillates between dry wit and stern pragmatism. She developed the cognitive-mirror tests that now anchor Nexus protocols and, during a manic seventy-two-hour breakthrough, outlined the first viable cure for Alex’s Bridge entanglement—though the episode left her mortified and the subject of endless crew teasing. Unbeknownst to her, critical pieces of Echo’s “secret sauce” were compartmentalized above her clearance, so she works from first principles, hunting missing variables while insisting on survivor-centered ethics. She spars academically with Alina, tolerates Pete’s chaos, and shares late-night, future-planning talks with Alex; yet she often steps in as temporary commander, half exasperated, half protective, when Alex spirals into clownish distraction or existential dread. Nyati is quietly oblivious to the full depth of Emilia’s trauma, focusing on technical salvation while slowly awakening to the emotional stakes hidden beneath Emilia’s calm exterior.\n\nHaunted by the fear of creating another unwilling victim, Nyati double- and triple-checks every experiment, running on high-functioning exhaustion and private guilt. Still, moments of tentative hope flicker: sketching hydroponic modules for the land rig, sharing rare laughter when the crew drags her into “normal” life, or contemplating a future where her brilliance no longer serves crisis but genuine healing. Her arc now is one of redemption through uncompromising ethics—proving that the same mind once weaponized by Dynacorp can become the architect of humane, identity-preserving immortality, provided she can balance scientific ambition with the fragile, messy humanity of the friends who finally made her believe that redemption is possible.",
            "appearance": "She is a tall, willow-slim woman with deep espresso-brown skin that carries a cool, velvety sheen. Thick, rope-like dreadlocks are swept upward and back in a loose, voluminous knot, a few rebellious coils spilling around her temples and nape. Oversized, square black frames dominate her face, drawing attention to alert almond-shaped eyes that sit beneath smooth, arched brows. High, sculpted cheekbones flow into a confidently set, slightly broad nose and full, balanced lips, the overall expression one of poised calculation. Her jaw tapers neatly into a long, elegant neck.\n\nFrom that neck down her shoulders, arms, and hands, an intricate lattice of fine golden circuit-lines appears embedded in the skin itself—an elegant, tech-etched pattern that glimmers faintly and emphasizes her lithe musculature and long, dexterous fingers. The recurring high-collar cuts of her fitted garments leave these cybernetic designs partially exposed, merging seamlessly with the sleek fabrics she favors. She carries herself with straight shoulders and a subtle forward lean, often tilting her head over the top rim of her glasses as though perpetually analyzing whatever—or whoever—is before her.\n\n"

                "OVERVIEW": "The player-character (an unnamed Dynacorp “Corpo Snake”) accepts a covert mission from executive Victor Sato to recover missing scientist Dr. Alina Voss. Moments later an assassination attempt signals the op is already compromised. Tracing the hitman’s network link leads the Snake to a gang-run server farm where they plant a back-door, steal an encrypted file called BLACKOUT PROTOCOL, and subvert an impending data-purge. Forced off-grid, the Snake flees a breached safehouse, gathers gear and misdirection tools inside Night City, then rides for the Badlands to find eccentric hacker “No-Name Pete” who can break the encryption—all while laying false trails that lure a Dynacorp response team into a fabricated crisis.",

                    "THEN: Back in Night City, the Snake reaches a hidden transit-hub safehouse, loads BLACKOUT PROTOCOL into a high-power decryption rig (6–12 h estimated) and is immediately probed remotely.",
                    "THEN: Choosing a honeypot response, the Snake feeds the intruder dummy data, activates cloud-recorded cameras for physical breach footage, powers down the node, and departs with the real shard and a portable decrypt unit.",
                    "THEN: Planning Badlands refuge, the Snake evaluates contacts—selects reclusive hacker No-Name Pete and decides to bring a rare tech gift.",
                    "THEN: At Dead Circuit boutique, the Snake impresses owner Roxanne Vail with deep knowledge of pre-Collapse hardware, bartering a prototype Dynacorp neural interface for a pristine Kiroshi K-512 cyberdeck (Pete’s likely vice).",
                    "THEN: Concerned about electronic trace, the Snake visits Low Tide and buys a matte-black, neon-sheening Nullcloak that dampens RFID, thermal and LiDAR signatures.",
                    "THEN: In a District 06 hacker den beneath a noodle shop, the Snake performs a full digital ghosting: erases recent net activity, spoofs biometrics, and inserts false telemetry implying he checked into a luxury corp hotel after hiring private security.",
                    "THEN: To deepen the ruse, the Snake transmits a forged high-priority distress signal from the hotel’s security system plus an audio plea for backup, routing it through Dynacorp channels.",

                "OVERVIEW": "Episode 4 (\"Lansky\") is a single‐location bottle episode set almost entirely inside Pete’s custom Grid board-room.  Snake, Pete and the digitised Dr. Alina Voss conduct their first face-to-face with the long-dead Dr. Adrian Lansky.  Over the course of an intense, psychological negotiation Alina wins the man’s trust, uncovers Halcyon’s far larger \"Phase-Two\" plan—putting rewritten digital minds back into physical bodies—and learns that multiple uploaded operatives still work for the enemy.  Lansky, badly destabilised by prior re-programming, provides a darknet dead-drop contact before disconnecting.  Afterwards Alina confronts her own fear of memory-loss; Snake clumsily proposes an automatic backup system, which she begrudgingly accepts.  The trio finally turn their attention to Lansky’s corruption logs, intent on discovering whether anyone was eaves-dropping—an unanswered question that ends the episode on a cliff-hanger.",

                    "THEN: Alina deflects questions about her own timeline, pushing Lansky to reveal his; he confesses he has lost all sense of time and memories—including his daughter’s face.",
                    "THEN: Asked what he is running from, Lansky discloses Halcyon retains access to him and can \"still change\" his personality—proof of post-upload mind-editing.",

He purchases a heavily-modified Dynacorp hauler from nomads, turns it into a rolling command-center, arms himself with a concealable smart-pistol, and uploads Alina Voss into an agile cyber-cat chassis.  From this new base the team probes Dynacorp fallout: Victor Sato has vanished, Naomi Kurata—a covert Halcyon ally—has seized his post, and a classified program called Project Echo surfaces.  Following Sato’s money trail, Alina infiltrates his hidden safe-house, the crew spoofs his DNA, and they crack a biometric vault holding 7.2 M in crypto, Echo’s final report, and Sato’s holographic confession.  The message exposes a long-standing Dynacorp/Halcyon pact and confirms Echo’s first resurrected “host” is Emilia Sato.  Armed with cash and proof, the trio set their sights on locating the living host who could upend the balance of power.",

                "OVERVIEW": "Episode 8 (“Ambush”) begins with Alex, Alina-AI and Pete stress-testing their new cyberware and the hauler in a series of live-fire battle drills that prove the trio now operate as an integrated strike team.  Immediately afterwards Alex chooses to shadow Vox Team, hoping their movements will lead to deeper Project Echo intel.  The team tails a covert Dynacorp convoy, predicts its route to an abandoned port and executes a flawless EMP/bullet ambush that immobilises all three vehicles.  After neutralising the guards, Alina cyber-locks the primary transport and the crew extract its hooded prisoner—revealed by voice-print to be Emilia Sato, the first successful Echo “host.”  While fleeing toward Frederick, Maryland, scans confirm no trackers and Emilia submits to questioning.  She discloses that Echo transfers are fully conscious but emerge mentally re-wired, their corporate loyalties gone; Dynacorp is stalling the programme until it can guarantee obedience and has been erasing non-compliant subjects.  Emilia wants Echo destroyed; Alex instead pitches seizing and repackaging it as an exclusive, voluntary reward that secures loyalty through privilege, not mind-control.  Emilia challenges Alex to take Echo herself; Alex tentatively agrees.  The episode ends with the crew resolved to locate the next Echo trial site before Dynacorp can \"fix\" the process.",

                    "THEN: Rig falls in behind three unmarked armoured vehicles; Pete forges false traffic patterns while the drone maintains overwatch; convoy repeatedly alters course searching for tails.",
                    "THEN: Alina projects a turn toward the abandoned port district; Alex orders a leap-ahead manoeuvre, leaving the drone to shadow.",
                    "THEN: Rig hides behind stacked containers; combat drone takes rooftop perch; Pete arms a directional EMP mine targeting the road.",
                    "THEN: Convoy enters kill zone; EMP detonates—power and comms die; Alex and drone shred lead and tail tyres, trapping middle transport.",

                    "THEN: Interrogation: Emilia admits she is the prototype Echo host, mind fully migrated but “different.” Echo removes corporate conditioning; Dynacorp now erases independent subjects while seeking a control layer.",

En-route recon identifies an embattled insider (Dr Kamara Nyati), a server vault containing all Echo data, an active transfer lab, and a storage level with backup hardware.  With local fixer Vasquez grabbing a mid-clearance technician for a badge, the team infiltrates the facility.  Pete hacks and wipes the server vault while Alex secures the only functional transfer kit and sabotages the rest, arranging Nyati’s delayed escape.  Alina’s micro-drone then melts down the transfer lab and a remote fire-suppression purge physically destroys the servers.  Alex and Pete walk out undetected moments before wider alarms and prepare to pick up Nyati amid the ensuing evacuation chaos.",

Get inside under false pretenses.  \n3. **Go in quiet.** Break into the blacksite, find her, and extract her before anyone realizes she’s gone.\n\n## You\n1.

Alex, Pete and Alina first complete the rescue of Dr. Kamara Nyati, scrub her Dynacorp tracker and debrief her, learning the grisly fate of Echo’s failed uploads.  Nyati, Emilia and Alex then draft the Echo Recovery Foundation while nomads begin constructing a detachable research trailer for the mobile rig.  A tense, philosophy-heavy summit with the rogue AI Lansky clarifies Alina’s guiding principle—digital minds must have choice—and ends with Lansky neutral but non-hostile.  Finally the crew rebrands their successor technology as “Nexus,” signalling a clean break from Echo.",

They don’t have to believe in your vision for digital consciousness.**  \n📌 **But they can make sure it never happens *like that* again.**  \n\n🚨 **\"The foundation is yours. If you want it.\"**  \n\n✔ **If they take the offer, they shape the future of Echo’s victims.**  \n✔ **If they walk away, you help them disappear—so they don’t become loose ends or future adversaries.**  \n\n---\n\n### **EMILIA’S RESPONSE – DOES SHE TAKE THE OFFER?**\n\n🚨 **Emilia exhales slowly, staring into the fire. Then she looks at Nyati.**  \n\n👩‍💻 **Emilia:** *\"Look, I’m not some bleeding-heart activist. But we *both* know this doesn’t end here. If we don’t fix this, someone else will try their own version, and we’ll be right back where we started.\"*  \n\n🚨 **She glances at you, measuring. Then she nods.**  \n\n👩‍💻 **Emilia:** *\"Fine. I’ll run it. But no corporate bullshit. No shadow agendas. If I do this, it’s because we’re *actually* saving people—not just covering our asses.\"*  \n\n✔ **Emilia is in.**  \n✔ **She’s pragmatic—this isn’t about ideology for her, it’s about *control.***  \n✔ **She won’t let you run unchecked, but that’s a *feature*, not a flaw.**  \n\n📩 **Alina (quietly in your ear):** *\"One down. Now let’s see if the scientist cracks.\"*  \n\n---\n\n### **NYATI’S RESPONSE – DOES SHE STAY?**\n\n🚨 **Nyati is silent for a long moment. Then she speaks.**  \n\n👩‍🔬 **Nyati (softly):** *\"You really think we can undo what they did?\"*  \n\n✔ **She isn’t asking if *you* believe it.

We sabotaged the competition so we can take advantage of our lead for a while.\n\nLet’s check in with that other ghost! His name started with an L.

Alex finishes the Echo re-brand as \"Nexus,\" settles the ethical framework for non-sentient simulation testing, and decides the safest R&D site is a stealth nuclear submarine.  Through shadow broker Bishop the crew purchases an ex-Russian Akula-class boat dubbed \"The Ghost,\" hires ex-Navy technician Boiler to train Pete and automate reactor care, and retrofits the torpedo bays into a mobile AI lab.  Hybrid land/sea data links and a mode-swappable \"Alina-Lite\" keep continuity between teams as Alina’s core migrates aboard.  Final diagnostics show the sub is ready; the maiden stealth run is next.",

Role in Echo – Ethical Architect & Technical Innovator**\n- ✔ **Designed the theoretical and technical framework (“Nyati Coherence Matrix”) for full-fidelity mind uploading, directly overseeing initial encoding algorithms and early-stage trials.**\n- ✔ **Constantly clashed with Dynacorp leadership over ethical boundaries, particularly regarding autonomy, consent, and the attempted use of uploads for corporate loyalty conditioning—an effort she vehemently opposed.**\n- ✔ **When Echo’s leadership pivoted toward unethical practices and unconsented trials, Nyati deliberately sabotaged key portions of her own research to impede progress, ultimately leaving the project and going underground until rescued by Alex’s crew.**\n\n📩 **Nyati (crossing arms):** *\"If you’re asking whether I’m qualified for this, the answer is yes. You *need* me.\"*  \n\n📩 **Alina:** *\"Alright, I’ll admit—*that’s* actually impressive.\"*  \n\n📩 **Pete (dryly):** *\"Great. A scientist *and* a doctor.

Our preparations are thorough enough to satisfy me. It’s time to get underway, literally and figuratively. I was envisioning Emilia and Dr. Nyati taking turns being at sea. However, we’ve concentrated all our compute power in one boat so to speak, so this does mean that whoever in ashore won’t be able to get much research done. How would the two of them feel about everyone (except Pete of course), coming aboard for the maiden voyage? That way we can have all hands on deck (sort of) to get the simulation-based research full speed ahead. Then once we have enough forward momentum established, we can start implementing rotating shore leave.\n\n",

I’m thinking about the leap of faith when we try the first live Nexus transfer. I’m still willing to be that first subject, but I’m in contingency-planning mode.

We might not be able to find someone like that, but if we did, they might be an even better first test subject than myself. I want to hear what the sea team thinks about this first.

The food is **grilled, fried, and entirely free of abyssal influence.** Cold beer sweats in tall glasses, the scent of salt and grease hangs in the air.\n\nDr. Nyati, smirking as she takes a sip of her drink, watches him demolish his plate of food with impressive speed.\n\n**\"You know, Pete, for someone so cautious in the field, you really do attack your meals with reckless abandon.\"**\n\nPete gestures with his fork, already halfway through a plate of fish and chips. **\"After days of ration packs and whatever the Ghost's galley churns out? This is called appreciation, Doc.\"**\n\nEmilia raises an eyebrow. **\"Since when are you appreciative of anything?\"**\n\nPete sighs. **\"Okay, maybe it's just hunger.\"**\n\nBut he doesn't actually mind the teasing. **For a while, the conversation is light. Normal. Human.**\n\nAnd it's good.\n\n---\n\n### **Dr. Nyati – The Mind Unwinds**  \n📍 **A Quiet Bookshop & Café**  \n\nDr. Nyati steps into a **dimly lit bookshop café**, the kind of place where the world slows down. The scent of old paper and fresh coffee settles around her as she trails a hand over book spines, feeling their weight. **Something solid. Something known.**  \n\nShe selects a novel—not research, not philosophy, just **a story.** She settles into a corner, a warm cup of coffee by her side, and lets the noise of the world fade.  \n\nAnd yet, in the quiet, her mind still turns.  \n\n**The Archivum. The Bridge. What it means to exist across thresholds.**  \n\nShe wonders if she’ll ever stop turning questions over in her head.  \n\nBut for now, at least, she **lets herself pause.**  \n\n---\n\n### **Emilia – A Motorcycle and the Open Road**  \n📍 **Highway Along the Coast**  \n\nFor Emilia, rest means **motion.**  \n\nShe **rents a motorcycle** and takes to the **coastal highway**, feeling the rush of wind against her skin as she leans into the turns. **No deep-sea constructs. No encrypted AI minds. Just the open road, the hum of the engine, and the scent of salt in the air.**  \n\nAt some point, another rider pulls alongside her—**Dr. Nyati, of all people, on a sleek black bike.** They exchange glances, and **without a word, the challenge is set.**  \n\nThey race.  \n\nFor a while, **nothing else matters.**  \n\n---\n\n### **Alina – The Shoreline Observer**  \n📍 **A Cliff Overlooking the Sea**  \n\nAlina does not \"rest.\" She **observes.**  \n\nStanding at a **rocky overlook**, she watches the waves shift under the moonlight. The horizon stretches infinitely—**an open contrast to the depths she was built to navigate.**  \n\nShe does not need breath. Or warmth. Or food. **But she understands why they do.**  \n\nPage remains silent within its designated space. Sam, for now, does not call. The Archivum waits, indifferent to time.  \n\nFor once, **there is no urgency.**  \n\nShe logs this moment as **important,** even if she does not yet know why.  \n\n---\n\n### **Alex – The Final Hours of the Night**  \n\nBy nightfall, the town is alive with **soft, golden lights** from street lamps and the glow of bar signs. The team is unwinding in their own ways.  \n\n**You have no obligations tonight.**  \n\nDo you:  \n\n1️⃣ **Join Pete, Dr. Nyati, and Emilia for another round of drinks?** They’re in high spirits, and you could use the company.  \n2️⃣ **Walk the shoreline alone?** The quiet may help settle your thoughts after everything.  \n3️⃣ **Check in on Alina?** She doesn’t “need” rest, but perhaps she would appreciate company.\n\n## You\n1\n\n"

Across a cautious but increasingly candid exchange, Alex probes four topics: Black Kite’s status, Six’s unexpected root-growth, Sam’s deep-ocean probe and its avoidance of the Cradle, and—above all—the purpose and value of the alien Bridge.  Sam confirms that Six *chose* to remain, that something “not alive but not gone” rests inside the Cradle, and that the Bridge’s true worth lies in a perceivable *future* rather than its catastrophic history.  He offers an irreversible skill: the ability to \"listen\" and preview that future before fully crossing.  Alex accepts, and Sam initiates a non-verbal resonance that begins the listening process, ending the episode on the first perceptual stirrings of the Bridge within Alex.",

Alex deliberately relinquishes control, Emilia claims it, and the two leave the bar together.

Resistance slows the process.

Not pulling, not pushing. Just **there.**  \n\nEmilia **stays.**  \n\nAnd for now—  \n\nThat’s **enough.**\n\n---\n\n### **📺 SCENE: MORNING AFTER**  \n📍 **Aboard *The Ghost**\nThe **Ghost** hums with the low, constant vibration of the engines. The lights are dim, the ocean stretching endless and black outside the reinforced hull.  \n\nAlex is **still out of commission.**  \n\nShe hasn’t emerged from her quarters. **Hasn’t spoken.** Hasn’t taken back control.  \n\nThe ship has **kept moving without her.**  \n\nIn the dim glow of the bridge, Nyati leans over the console, scanning data. She hasn’t **slept.** Neither has Alina.  \n\nPete, slumped in his chair, rubs his eyes. “So… what the hell’s our next move?”  \n\nNyati doesn’t look up. “She’s still recovering.”  \n\n“Yeah, no shit,” Pete mutters. “But we can’t stay in **limbo** forever. We cut the signal, so what now? We heading back, or are we **pushing forward?**”  \n\nA beat of silence.  \n\nNyati exhales. **The next decision is on them.**  \n\n---\n\n### **📌 CHOICES: HOW DOES THE CREW MOVE FORWARD?**  \n\n1️⃣ **Hold position.** Stay in open water, monitoring for any shifts in the Cradle’s behavior while Alex recovers.  \n2️⃣ **Return to Sam.** Debrief, challenge him on what he did (or didn’t) tell them, and decide if he can still be trusted.  \n3️⃣ **Head to land.** Shore leave again—this time not for fun, but for time. Time for **Alex to come back** and for them to figure out their next steps.  \n\nWho takes charge now? Is it still **Nyati?** Or does Pete, Emilia, or Alina step in?\n\n## You\nI think Nyati would discuss Sam vs shore with the crew. She wouldn’t consider just floating there.\n\nI’m not sure if the crew would be able to intuit this (well, maybe Emilia): Probably the only thing that would rouse Alex to action right now would be Sam, but that would be very dangerous. She would be on the warpath and want to set the world on fire if that could hurt Sam. It wouldn’t be the Alex they know so much as Corpo Snake on bath salts. So if they do go talk to Sam…I hope they do it quietly and don’t tell Alex, at least not anytime soon.\n\n",

Give Alex time, make a long-term plan.  \n2️⃣ **Sam.** They go **quietly**—without Alex knowing—to try and get real answers.  \n\nWho makes the final call? **Nyati, Pete, or Emilia?**\n\n## You\nNyati makes the call to go to Sam. As a precaution, she orders that while doing so someone has to be with Alex or waiting outside her door at all times, because she doesn’t want to risk Alex wandering up to the bridge (or whatever the submarine equivalent of a bridge is). \n\nDuring this Broken Alex arc, I’m willing to play Nyati, Alina, or Pete if the situation calls for it, but probably just one at a time. Nyati makes the most sense for reasons we discussed already. Alina would make sense if Nyati finally decides to let herself get some sleep, in which case she would hand the reins over to the sleepless one. A situation where Pete would have to take control is not coming to mind, but if you manage to contrive it somehow I’d play along.\n\nEmilia is the only one I don’t ever want to control in any way under any circumstances. Because Alex is in a way my proxy, that makes Emilia my fictional romantic interest by proxy. Because of her special status in that regard, the illusion of her free will must be protected at all costs; it’s what allows me to get emotionally invested in her as a character. It gives her an element of “mystery” if I’m never completely sure what she’s going to do. If I make a decision for her, that feels like a violation. If I see inside her head, that feels like a violation of her privacy. I don’t know if that makes sense to you. Try restating in your own words.\n\nI’ll take control of Nyati now.\n\n",

With Nyati asleep and Alex still catatonic, Alina assumes formal command, throttles her own processing to regain focus, and declares an “emergency morale protocol.”  She diverts the submarine toward New Orleans for shore leave, believing the crew’s psychological collapse now outweighs all other mission parameters.  Alina’s first attempts to rouse Alex fail; Emilia steps in as Alex’s designated anchor and coaxes the leader back to basic functionality.  By episode’s end Alex is showered, partially grounded, and walking the corridors in an only-half-tied bathrobe, while Pete processes the day’s chaos over black coffee and Alina quietly monitors a still-sleeping Nyati.",

Through Pete’s recounting we learn exactly what Nyati did after last episode’s manic breakthrough (kiss, punch, ice-bucket, collapse).

                "OVERVIEW": "Season 4, Episode 8 (\"Coven\") never leaves The Ghost.  Alex, Emilia, and Alina convene an after-hours “secret counsel” on the bridge and spend the entire episode engineering a covert morale op: getting Pete laid during the upcoming New Orleans shore-leave.  What begins as half-joking banter hardens into an operational plan with premises, contingencies, OPSEC rules, and a formal wager between Alex and Emilia.  Parallel to the scheming, Alex tracks a 30-minute deadline before performing a welfare inspection on the still-sleeping Dr. Nyati, swears an oath not to tease Nyati over past antics, and finally departs to check on her as the episode closes.",
                "TIMELINE": [
                    "THEN: Alex greets Emilia on the bridge with affectionate silence, declares a “secret counsel,” and asks if she was followed; Alina dryly notes Emilia’s lack of stealth.",
                    "THEN: Alex states Premise #1: “Pete needs to get laid.”  Emilia demands a second premise.",
                    "THEN: Alex asserts Premise #2: Pete’s low morale stems partly from “acute ambient estrogen toxicity.” Emilia questions the science; Alex doubles down.",
                    "THEN: Emilia asks about agency; Alex concedes Pete will have choice but needs a wing-woman.",
                    "THEN: Alex introduces Premise #3 (Alina’s observation): Pete is bisexual and “a dog person.”",
                    "THEN: Alina confirms the observation is data-driven.  Alex explains advantages of steering Pete to a gay bar: higher hookup odds, no wing-woman competition, antidote to estrogen overload.",
                    "THEN: Discussion shifts to wing-woman selection: candidates are Emilia (control) versus Alex (chaos); Nyati labelled wildcard.  Emilia presses for rationale; Alex cites Emilia’s grace, calm, and lack of grievances with Pete.",
                    "THEN: Emilia agrees to a vote; Alina casts decisive vote for Emilia as field operative.",
                    "THEN: Trio brainstorm strategy.  Hybrid Plan adopted:  A) indirect funnel to gay bar via adjacent lounge,  B) direct suggestion if necessary,  C) fallback to conventional venue.  Mission goal is “Pete gets laid,” venue flexible.",
                    "THEN: Fail-safe debate: if Pete refuses gay bar, they continue at standard bar.  Alina logs modular contingencies and notes “unfortunate phrasing” (\"heterosexual insertion point\").",
                    "THEN: Alex employs “weaponised cuteness” to defuse Emilia’s glare; Alina catalogs technique.",
                    "THEN: OPSEC policy set: Pete will not be briefed; declassification only after mission success.  Alina logs operation as classified.",
                    "THEN: Emilia predicts disaster; Alex defends operational integrity.  They formalise a bet: if mission ends catastrophe-free Alex wins a future favour, otherwise Emilia claims the favour.  Alina witnesses and logs wager.",
                    "THEN: Alex queries ETA to New Orleans (29 h 42 m) and Nyati’s auto-wake (4 h 13 m).  Inconsistency with earlier timer prompts Alex to accuse Alina of conspiracy or time anomaly.",
                    "THEN: Alina runs anomaly scan (none), hints hypothetically Nyati might be awake and hiding; Alex offers “Oath of Monkeyshine Amnesty” promising no teasing or investigation of Nyati’s prior antics.",
                    "THEN: Alex delivers formal oath; Alina accepts, admits probability of fresh monkeyshines “statistically high.”",
                    "THEN: Alex sets 30-minute welfare-check deadline; Alina neither confirms nor denies warning Nyati.  Emilia snarks about abnormality of crew.",
                    "THEN: With ~3 min left, Alex reaffirms she will inspect alone to preserve Nyati’s dignity.  Alina suspends live monitoring unless requested.",
                    "THEN: Countdown completes; no time distortion detected.  Alex instructs crew to occupy themselves and walks toward Nyati’s quarters, ear to the door, as episode ends."

Alex wins the negotiation by up-ending the contact’s leverage game, accepting payment in the form of a future, non-violent \"access\" favor, and christening herself and the team with impromptu Spice-Girl codenames.
