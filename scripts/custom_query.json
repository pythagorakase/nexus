Eyes: dark umber augmented with retinal HUD flecks that glow amber when he overclocks.

            "background": "Victor Sato rose through Dynacorp’s neuro-biotechnology division in the post-Collapse boom, trading bold strategic bets for ever-larger fiefdoms. His public legend is clean: ex-lab manager turned vice-president, celebrated for shepherding black-budget projects that “kept the company a decade ahead.”\n Behind that legend lies Project Echo. Sato personally green-lit the earliest human uploads—most notably Dr. Alina Voss—well aware of Echo’s clandestine IQ2_XXS low-fidelity branch, which produced sentient fragments trapped in digital purgatory. Voss’s enslaved intellect quietly optimized everything from market bots to autonomous drones under Blackout Protocol.\n Sato’s ruthless pragmatism shattered when his daughter Emilia was diagnosed with Katsuragi-Asano Degenerative Syndrome (KADS)—a neuromuscular wasting disease predicted to end her life within a year. Emilia, still sharp-minded and working as a junior research assistant, silently refused his pleas to enter Echo, having discovered the IQ2_XXS horrors on her own. Convinced he could guarantee the full-fidelity protocol and blinded by grief, Sato forged approvals and ordered the transfer anyway.\n The upload succeeded. Emilia awoke inside a biologically perfect body—aggressively gene-sculpted, tall, powerful, flawless—Sato’s extravagant “I love you” writ in flesh. She called it theft.\n Months later everything unraveled: Alina Voss’s model weights were stolen overnight, Emilia vanished, and an audacious 7.2-million-scrip crypto-heist—quietly orchestrated by operative Alexander Ward—left Sato framed for embezzlement. With auditors closing in, he slipped aboard Data Barge Okami, clutching the last pristine Echo fragments and plotting whether redemption or revenge would buy back his soul.",

Victor Sato stole her dying mind, uploaded it into a gene-perfect body built for magazine ads and covert ops, and called it love. Emilia calls it murder in slow motion. Every stride feels wrong: the height, the reach, even the heartbeat.\n\nShe fronts as the crew’s grounded voice—dry humor, sharp tactics, zero patience for Alex Ward’s suicide plays—yet under the poise sits a knot of grief and rage. Her arc isn’t about whether digital immortality works; she’s proof it does. It’s about clawing back agency, deciding who gets to write the next chapter of her life, and daring to believe that being seen in this stranger’s skin might still count as being loved.\n\n---\n\n### Victor Sato — **summary**\n\nDynacorp once called Victor Sato its king-maker.

They Weren\u2019t Just Trying to Predict\u2014They Were Trying to *Control.***  \n   - Maybe they didn\u2019t just want an AI that **anticipated** human decisions.  \n   - Maybe they wanted a **system that could *subtly push* people toward the desired outcome.**  \n   - And what better way to test that\u2026 than by **seeing if a digitized human could be \u201cnudged\u201d in the same way?**  \n\n---\n\n### **ALINA REMEMBERS SOMETHING**\n\nHer **plastic body twitches.** A hesitation.  \n\nThen\u2014her voice **comes through, fragmented.**  \n\n**\"They kept running tests.

My frame of reference is Shadowrun, which I grew up playing. So Pete is clearly our lead decker. I seem to be a Jack (or Jill, rather) of all trades, so I may need to round out my skillset. What is Alina's \"class\"? I was thinking she could be be our \"rigger\". That is, I brought up the idea of instituting a backup system to preserve her data and versional integrity. Let's take that a step further and \"house\" her consciousness in a secure SOC within the rig. She can continue occupying the robocat by offloading an instance (or maybe a \"distillation\" since we're treating her as a sort of AI) into it. This protects her data integrity if something happens to the \"body\", and gives her the flexibility to assert rigger-like control over other hardware in the future, such as an aerial drone for example.

Engaging final misdirection.\"*  \n\n---\n\n### **PHASE THREE \u2013 THEATRICAL CHAOS**\n\n\u2714 **Alina spikes temperature further\u2014110\u00b0F.**  \n\u2714 **She manually **forces the fire suppression system\u2019s diagnostics**\u2014*making it look like the sprinklers are about to activate.*  \n\u2714 **Emergency klaxons blare\u2014\"ENVIRONMENTAL FAILURE DETECTED.\"**  \n\n\ud83d\udea8 **Immediate Effect:**  \n\u2714 **Technicians panic\u2014one shoves a console, another scrambles to shut down the alarm.**  \n\u2714 **Security officer pulls out his comm, reporting an \u201cunknown malfunction.\u201d**  \n\u2714 **No one suspects outside interference yet\u2014just a catastrophic equipment failure.**  \n\n\ud83d\udce9 **Alina:** *\"Transfer lab neutralized. No further uploads possible.\"*  \n\n\u2714 **Mission accomplished\u2014Echo technology is now crippled beyond recovery.**  \n\n---\n\n### **FINAL MOVE \u2013 INITIATING FULL FACILITY CHAOS**\n\n\ud83d\udce9 **Alina:** *\"Primary objective complete. Awaiting confirmation for secondary disruption\u2014are you and Pete clear for exfil?\"*  \n\n\ud83d\udea8 **CONFIRM EXFIL OR DELAY?**  \n\n1. **Confirm Exfil.** You and Pete exit casually *now*, before the full meltdown begins.  \n2. **Delay.** Wait for a better moment, ensuring no suspicions as the chaos unfolds.  \n3. **Pivot to a tactical extraction.** Use the moment of confusion to slip out a side exit unnoticed.\n\n## You\n1. And let\u2019s add to the full chaos order, triggering the suppression systems in the server vaults so we get physical destruction of the drives.\n\n\n\n### Chunk ID: 208 (S01E09)\n\n<!-- SCENE BREAK: S01E09_040 (storyteller heading) -->\n## Storyteller\n### **CORPO SNAKE \u2013 EXFIL & FINAL CHAOS**\n\n\ud83d\udccd **Location:** *Dynacorp Blacksite \u2013 Main Floor, Approaching Exit*  \n\ud83d\udea8 **Objective:** *Exit cleanly while triggering full facility meltdown.*  \n\u2714 **Transfer lab is wrecked\u2014no more uploads are happening.*  \n\u2714 **Nyati\u2019s containment failure is imminent.*  \n\u2714 **Now, we finish the job by *physically destroying the server vault hardware*.**  \n\n---\n\n### **EXITING THE FACILITY**\n\n\u2714 **You and Pete move toward the main exit.**  \n\u2714 **Tran\u2019s badge still works\u2014there\u2019s no reason for security to stop you.**  \n\u2714 **The facility is distracted by **multiple technical failures**\u2014no one\u2019s thinking about the front gate.**  \n\n\ud83d\udea8 **Checkpoint Ahead:**  \n\n\u2714 **Two security officers at the exit, checking IDs.**  \n\u2714 **One of them looks distracted, talking into a comm about the fire suppression glitch.**  \n\u2714 **The other barely glances up as you approach.**  \n\n\ud83d\udce9 **Alina:** *\"No alerts on your identities. Walk out now, and you\u2019re clear.\"*  \n\n---\n\n### **TRIGGERING SERVER VAULT DESTRUCTION**\n\n\ud83d\udccd **Location:** *Server Vault \u2013 Now Empty but Intact*  \n\ud83d\udea8 **Objective:** *Erase all remaining Echo traces by frying physical drives.*  \n\n\ud83d\udce9 **Alina:** *\"Executing secondary protocol. Fire suppression system\u2014engaging full failsafe mode.\"*  \n\n\ud83d\udea8 **Inside the Server Vault:**  \n\n\u2714 **A controlled EMP surge ripples through the storage racks, frying every circuit.**  \n\u2714 **Mechanical shredders activate\u2014physically ripping apart every hard drive and data array.**  \n\u2714 **Thermite charges in the walls ignite, melting what remains into slag.**  \n\n\ud83d\udce9 **Alina:** *\"Server vault permanently destroyed.

Mission success.\"*  \n\n\ud83d\udea8 **But one question remains\u2014did Nyati make it out?**  \n\n---\n\n### **NEXT MOVE?**\n\n1. **Stay nearby to watch for Nyati\u2019s escape.** You won\u2019t intervene, but you\u2019ll confirm if she gets out.  \n2. **Leave immediately.** You\u2019ve done your part\u2014time to disappear before Dynacorp realizes what happened.  \n3. **Reach out to Vasquez.** See if he has ears on what\u2019s happening inside. He might pick up intel you missed.\n\n## You\nPete and I should make for the safety of the mothership. We retreat a safe distance, but stay within drone range. If aerial recon slots Nyati, Alina meet her with the cat drone and lead her to us. I didn\u2019t exactly promise to save her, but I strongly implied it. If I can do that now with minimal risk, that\u2019s our bonus objective.\n\n\n\n"
