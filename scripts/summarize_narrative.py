NEXUS Narrative Summary Generator

This script generates comprehensive summaries of entire seasons or specific episodes
using GPT-4.1, saving the results to the appropriate tables in the PostgreSQL database.

Features:
- Multi-mode support: season summaries or episode summaries
- Episode range support: summarize multiple episodes in one run
- Database integration: saves summaries as structured JSONB to seasons and episodes tables
- Context-aware: includes padding chunks for better continuity
- Structured output: Uses OpenAI's structured output mode with Pydantic models for consistent results

Usage:
    # Summarize an entire season
    python summarize_narrative.py --season 3
    
    # Summarize a single episode
    python summarize_narrative.py --episode s03e01
    
    # Summarize a range of episodes
    python summarize_narrative.py --episode s03e01 s03e13
    
    # Manually specify chunk range (fallback option)
    python summarize_narrative.py --chunks 120 150
    
    # Options
    python summarize_narrative.py --season 3 --model gpt-4.1 --dry-run
