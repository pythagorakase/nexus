## Storyteller
📍 **The Ghost – Pre-Dive Preparations**

The team **moves with quiet efficiency.**  

The **air is different now.**  

Not **tense.**  

Not **uncertain.**  

Just **focused.**  

Because **this isn’t a scouting trip.**  

Because **this isn’t casual exploration.**  

Because **something reached out. And you are answering.**  

---

### **Operational Brief – Alina’s Report**  

Alina **stands at the console, reviewing systems, running calculations.**  

Then—**her voice comes through. Even. Certain.**"Preliminary dive parameters established. Projected descent time: four hours, twenty-two minutes."

Nyati, **checking a readout.**" Longer than usual."

Alina, **nodding slightly.**"Optimal approach route recalculated based on prior anomalies detected in the area. Adjustments made to minimize interference risk."

Pete, **leaning against the bulkhead.**"And if the interference *wants* us to take longer?"

Alina, **processing. Then—flatly:**"Then we will know before we arrive."

And you?  

You **exhale.**  

Because **there is no stopping this now.**  

Because **you are going back down.**  

And this time?  

This time **something is waiting.**  

---

### **Final Check – The Last Step Before Descent**  

2️⃣ **Ask Alina to run a final passive scan for anything unusual before you dive.**"If this thing is watching us, I want to know *how*."

3️⃣ **Check in with the crew—individually.**"Before we do this, let’s talk. One-on-one, no distractions."

4️⃣ **Say nothing. Just stand at the console, watching the readouts. Let them feel the weight of it. Let them be the ones to speak first.**

📍 **The Ghost – Pre-Dive Preparations**

The **ship hums.**  

The **final checks are running.**  

And you?  

You **turn away from the readouts.**  

Because **the tech is one thing.**  

Because **the mission is one thing.**  

But **the crew?**  

The **crew is what gets you through.**  

And before you **drop into whatever waits below, you need to check in.**  

One by one.  

No distractions.  

No noise.  

Just **them.**  

---

### **Who Do You Check In With First?**  

1️⃣ **Nyati.**"You’ve been quiet. What’s your read on this?"**See how she’s processing it—not just as a scientist, but as someone who knows how things go wrong.**  

2️⃣ **Pete.**"You’ve had a few near misses down there before. What’s your gut telling you this time?"**Gauge if his instincts are screaming about something you might have missed.**  

3️⃣ **Alina.**"You’ve been in control of The Ghost’s systems for a long time. Does this *feel* different to you?"**Check if anything about this dive feels *off* beyond just the obvious.**  

4️⃣ **Emilia.**"You knew we’d be going back. What’s on your mind?"**Press her on what she’s been thinking—because she has been thinking something.**

## You

## Storyteller
📍 **The Ghost – Pre-Dive Preparations**

The **systems run.**  

The **ship prepares.**  

And you?  

You **find Emilia.**  

She’s **standing near the viewport, arms crossed, looking out at the water.**  

Not **doing anything.**  

Not **checking instruments.**  

Just **thinking.**  

Waiting.  

Because **she knew this was coming.**  

Because **she hasn’t said a word since you made the call.**  

And that?  

That **means something.**  

So you **step beside her.**  

Not **too close. Not yet.**  

And then—**quiet, even, no pretense.**"You knew we’d be going back."

A pause.  

Then—**softer. Watching her.** "What’s on your mind?"

---

### **The Answer – What Emilia Says**  

For a **moment, she doesn’t speak.**  

She **just watches the darkening sky. The surface. The water waiting below.**  

Then—**without looking at you, her voice comes quiet. Measured.** "I don’t like when things reach."

A pause.  

Then—**her jaw tightens slightly.** "I like even less when they stop."

She **finally looks at you.**  

Her **eyes sharp, but not defensive. Not pushing you away.**  

Just **seeing you. Waiting.**  

And then—**quieter. More careful.** "Did you feel it? Not just the signal. The moment it *knew* you were listening?"

---

### **How Do You Respond?**  

1️⃣ **"Yeah. And it didn’t just stop—it *left.* That’s what unsettles me."** Acknowledge the real issue. Something didn’t just stop transmitting. It *withdrew.***  

2️⃣ **"It wasn’t expecting me. That’s what I think spooked it."** Reaffirm that you think this was accidental—that it wasn’t *meant* to be caught.

3️⃣ **"I think it wanted to say something. I think it might still be trying."** Consider the possibility that this was an unfinished message.

4️⃣ **Say nothing. Just watch her. See if *she* breaks the silence first.**

📍 **The Ghost – Pre-Dive Preparations**

The **ship is readying itself.**  

The **systems hum.**  

And Emilia?  

Emilia **is still watching you.**  

Waiting.  

Because **she needs to know if you felt it too.**  

If you **understood.**  

If you **recognized the moment it changed.**  

So you **don’t hesitate.**"Yeah."**  

A pause.  

Then—**low, certain.**"And it didn’t just stop—it *left.*"**  

Her **eyes flicker. Just slightly.**  

You **keep going.**"That’s what unsettles me."**  

Emilia **exhales slowly.**  

She **nods.**  

Then—**soft, almost to herself.**"Yeah. That’s what got me too."**  

---

### **The Shift – The Real Conversation Begins**  

For a **moment, neither of you speak.**  

The **ship hums around you. The others are moving, preparing.**  

But here?  

Here, it’s **just the two of you.**  

And then—**Emilia tilts her head slightly.**  

Watching you.  

**"So what do you think that means?"**  

A **test.**  

A **challenge.**  

Because **this isn’t just conversation anymore.**  

Because **she wants to know how far your thinking has gone.**  

How much **you’ve put together.**  

How much **you’re willing to say out loud.**  

---

### **Your Move – How Do You Answer?**  

1️⃣ **"It was *aware.* More than just a pattern, more than just a signal. It had intent. And that means it had a reason."**Establish that this was something *deliberate.***  

2️⃣ **"I think it’s afraid of us. Or maybe just of *me.*"**Consider that *you* were the variable that changed things.**  

3️⃣ **"It didn’t want to be seen. But that doesn’t mean it wasn’t waiting to be found."**Pose the possibility that it’s been *waiting* for something—someone—to cross that line.**  

4️⃣ **Say nothing. Let *her* fill the silence. See what *she* thinks first.**

## You

📍 **The Ghost – Pre-Dive Preparations**

Emilia **is watching you.**  

Waiting.  

Not **pushing.**  

Not **leading.**  

Just **waiting.**  

Because **she wants to know what you see.**  

Because **she is testing if you see what she does.**  

And you?  

You **don’t hesitate.**  

You **let the truth settle between you.**"It was *aware.*"**  

A pause.  

Then—**lower, deliberate, letting it take root.**"More than just a pattern. More than just a signal."**  

You **see the flicker in her expression.**  

Not **surprise.**  

Not **doubt.**  

Just **confirmation.**  

Because **she already knew.**  

And you?  

You **finish it.**"It had intent. And that means it had a reason."**  

---

### **The Reaction – Emilia’s Answer**  

She **inhales.**  

Then—**exhales slow, measured.**  

She **doesn’t immediately agree.**  

She **doesn’t immediately challenge.**  

Instead—**she considers.**  

And then—**finally, quietly, evenly:**"So what was the reason?"**  

Not **mocking.**  

Not **skeptical.**  

Genuine. **Searching.**  

Because **you both feel it now.**  

Because **this wasn’t just a signal bouncing in the dark.**  

Because **something reached.**  

Because **something *chose* to stop.**  

And because **that means something.**  

And you?  

You **have to decide what that is.**  

---

### **Next Move – What Do You Think?**  

1️⃣ **"It was reaching—but it wasn’t ready. I don’t think it knew what to do when I *heard* it."**It was incomplete. Hesitant. Maybe even *unsure*.**  

2️⃣ **"I think it was waiting for someone like me. Maybe even *me specifically.* And that should worry us."**Consider the possibility that it was reaching *for you.* And that it stopped for a reason.**  

3️⃣ **"The cradle isn’t just a place. It’s a *threshold.* And maybe whatever is down there has been waiting for someone to step across it."**Pose the idea that the real event hasn’t happened yet. That what you saw was just the beginning.**  

4️⃣ **Say nothing. Let her sit with the weight of it. Let her be the one to fill the silence this time.**

## You
“I don’t know, and I worry that going to it might not answer our questions either. We know it’s connected to the bridge. It’s a “failed crosser”. And how often have we actually gotten answers about,” Alex waves her hand around in exasperation, “any of this bridge crap?”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E01_006 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
📍 **The Ghost – Pre-Dive Preparations**

The **room is quiet.**  

The **ship hums.**  

The **deep waits below.**  

And Emilia?  

Emilia **is waiting for your answer.**  

And you?  

You **give her the truth.**"I don’t know."**  

A pause.  

Then—**a slow exhale. A shift of weight. A trace of frustration creeping in.**"And I worry that going to it might not answer our questions either."**  

She **tilts her head slightly. Watching. Still listening.**  

But you **keep going.**  

Because **you know where this is leading.**  

Because **you know how this game plays out.**"We know it’s connected to the bridge."**  

A beat.  

Then—**flatter. More certain.**"It’s a ‘failed crosser.’"**  

And that?  

That **lands.**  

Because **she knows.**  

Because **they all know.**  

Because **this isn’t the first time you’ve seen a thread, a pattern, a path that doesn’t lead anywhere.**  

So you **wave a hand, sharp, exasperated.**"And how often have we actually gotten answers about—"**  

A **pause. A shift of tone.**  

Then—**louder, half-laughing, half-exhausted—**"Any of this *bridge crap*?"**  

---

### **Immediate Fallout – The Team Reacts**  

✅ **Nyati, from the other side of the room, not even looking up.**"Never."**  

✅ **Pete, dry.**"Less than never."**  

✅ **Alina, clinically neutral.**"Data yield from bridge interactions remains insufficient for conclusive assessment."**  

✅ **Emilia, finally breaking into a *slight* smirk, shaking her head.**  

Then—**soft, quiet, measured.**"Yeah. That’s the problem, isn’t it?"**  

Because **she gets it.**  

Because **this isn’t just frustrating.**  

Because **it is *deliberately unknowable.* And that’s what makes it dangerous.**  

---

### **The Next Move – What Do You Do?**  

1️⃣ **"We go anyway. Because ‘not getting answers’ doesn’t mean ‘not learning something.’"**Commit to the dive, even knowing it may not give you what you want.**  

2️⃣ **"So we don’t play its game. We go on *our* terms. Control what we can."**Set the precedent that *you* decide how this plays out—not whatever is waiting below.**  

4️⃣ **Say nothing. Just let the frustration settle. Let her be the one to decide what comes next.**

## You
Alex turns to the rest of the team:

Well that’s not fair. We do know some things. It’s just a very small list considering how much effort we’ve spent. Let’s review. 

1. The bridge is an engine of transformation. Physical contact with it enables the process to begin, but may not be required at later stages. 
2. The transformation is voluntary, stepwise, and irreversible. 
3. The farther you cross, the more likely you are to vanish from this world. We know of no full crossers who returned.
4. Even partial crossing imbues a kind of insubstantial connection, both to the realm of the bridge, and to other crossers. 
5. Having a strong connection to something or someone (Alex takes Emilia’s hand now and gives it an affectionate squeeze) confers some kind of partial protection. 
6. Crossers may attempt to cross as a group. It is unclear whether this is protective. 

What am I forgetting? Anybody?

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E01_007 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
📍 **The Ghost – Pre-Dive Preparations**

The **room settles.**  

The **frustration lingers.**  

But you?  

You **don’t let it win.**  

You **turn to the others.**  

And then—**you reframe the problem.**  

---

### **The Review – What You Know**

"Well, that’s not fair. We do know some things."**  

A pause.  

Then—**you gesture slightly.**"It’s just… a very small list, considering how much effort we’ve spent."**  

Pete, **snorting.**"That’s an understatement."**  

Nyati, **dry.**"Tragic, but accurate."**  

Alina, **neutral.**"Compiling established data points."**  

And you?  

You **list them.**  

One by one.  

---

### **The Facts – The Truth of the Bridge**

"1. The bridge is an engine of transformation. Physical contact with it enables the process to begin, but may not be required at later stages." 

Nyati, **nodding slightly.** "We know it lingers after the first contact. The signal doesn’t sever."

"2. The transformation is voluntary, stepwise, and irreversible."

Alina, **confirming.** "No evidence of reversal or regression has been recorded in prior cases."

"3. The farther you cross, the more likely you are to vanish from this world. We know of no full crossers who returned."**  

Pete, **grimacing.**"Yeah. That’s the one I don’t like."

"4. Even partial crossing imbues a kind of insubstantial connection, both to the realm of the bridge, and to other crossers."

Alina, **processing.** "Confirmed through both empirical observation and direct personal experience."

Then—**a pause.**  

Your **eyes flicker toward Emilia.**  

And as you **reach for her hand, taking it, squeezing gently—**  

She **lets you.**  

Doesn’t **pull away.**  

Doesn’t **fight it.**  

Just **lets the moment happen.**  

And when you speak, your voice is **softer.**  

"More **certain.** 5. Having a strong connection to something or someone confers some kind of partial protection."

Emilia, **silent.**  

Then—**quiet, watching you.** "Yeah."

And you?  

You **continue.** "6. Crossers may attempt to cross as a group. It is unclear whether this is protective."

Nyati, **thoughtful.** "We know past groups have tried. What we don’t know is if they failed *because* they went together—or despite it."**  

A **longer silence.**  

Then—**Pete, deadpan.** "Great. Love that for us."**  

---

### **The Question – What’s Missing?**  

You **exhale.**  

Then—**look to the others.**"What am I forgetting? Anybody?"

A **pause.**  

Then—**Alina speaks first.** "Secondary observation: bridge interactions are cumulative."**  

You **tilt your head.**"Meaning?"  

Alina, **steady.**"No full crossers have returned. However, *partial* crossers persist. Every interaction increases retention. Each time you listen, the bridge listens back."

A **beat.**  

Then—**Nyati, quietly:** "So it doesn’t just *take*. It *keeps* something."  

You **absorb that.**  

And then—**Emilia speaks.**  

Still **holding your hand.**  

Still **watching you.**  

Her **voice is lower, more careful.** "8."

A **pause.**  

Then—**her grip in your hand tightens slightly.** "There’s something on the other side."

You **inhale.**  

And you **know she’s right.**  

Because **you saw something.**  

Because **you felt it.**  

Because **you are not the only one listening.**  

---

### **Next Move – How Do You Respond?**  

2️⃣ **"Then we should assume it’s watching. Not just the bridge, but *us*." **Consider that it isn’t just waiting—it’s *aware* of you now.**  

3️⃣ **"That’s what we’re going to find out, isn’t it?" **Acknowledge that this mission is about more than the cradle now. It’s about who—or what—is behind all of this.**  

4️⃣ **Say nothing. Just hold Emilia’s gaze. Let the others be the ones to say it out loud.**

## You
“Yes. It’s a ‘stare into the abyss and the abyss stares back’ kind of deal for sure. I’ve made what felt like pretty direct eye contact during my first listening session. Wasn’t aggressive, but it was unmistakably aware.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E01_008 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
📍 **The Ghost – Pre-Dive Preparations**

The **words settle.**  

The **team listens.**  

And you?  

You **don’t hesitate.**  

Because **you’ve already faced it.**  

Because **you’ve already felt it.**  

Because **you were there when it looked back.**  

So you **say it plainly.**"Yes."**  

A **pause.**  

Then—**more certain, more measured.**"It’s a ‘stare into the abyss and the abyss stares back’ kind of deal for sure."**  

Nyati, **exhaling sharply, muttering.**"Fantastic. Love that."**  

Pete, **grimacing.**"It didn’t do anything though? Just… stared?"**  

You **nod.**"I’ve made what felt like pretty direct eye contact during my first listening session."**  

A **beat.**  

Then—**softer.**  

More **careful.**"Wasn’t aggressive."**  

A **pause.**  

Then—**the truth.**"But it was unmistakably aware."**  

---

### **Immediate Fallout – The Team Reacts**  

✅ **Nyati, arms crossed.**"That makes me more nervous, not less."**  

✅ **Pete, shaking his head.**"Yeah. Same. It *could* have been aggressive and wasn’t. Which means it chose not to be. And that’s… a choice."**  

✅ **Emilia, thumb running absently over the back of your hand, silent.**  

And you?  

You **watch them.**  

Because **the fear is reasonable.**  

Because **they know as well as you do—**This thing doesn’t have to be hostile to be dangerous.**  

And now?  

Now **you have to decide what to do with that knowledge.**  

---

### **Next Move – How Do You Proceed?**  

1️⃣ **"Then we go in assuming we’re already being watched."**Treat this like an intelligence mission. Assume observation. Act accordingly.**  

2️⃣ **"We test it. We see if it *reacts* again."**Before committing to full engagement, see if it reaches back when you listen again.**  

3️⃣ **"If it wanted to hurt me, it could have. But it didn’t."**Reframe the conversation—this might not be an enemy, just an observer.**  

4️⃣ **Say nothing. Just let them sit with the weight of it. Let *them* be the ones to push forward.**

## You
“And I’ll say again—knowing we have a responder bias or, worse, a survivor bias—this product has no positive reviews. Very limited word of mouth for advertising. Still manages to penetrate an admittedly niche market sector. I just don’t see this working with our product lineup.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E01_009 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
📍 **The Ghost – Pre-Dive Preparations**

The **tension lingers.**  

The **weight of it sits between you all.**  

And you?  

You **cut through it the only way you know how.**  

By **framing it in the language of a world you used to control.**  

By **putting it in terms you understand.**  

So you **exhale, shake your head, and let the words come.**  

---

### **The Analysis – A Bad Investment**

"And I’ll say again—"

You **gesture vaguely, half-exasperated, half-amused.**"Knowing we have a responder bias or, worse, a survivor bias—"

Nyati, **nodding slightly.**"Yeah. We don’t even know how many were lost before they had a chance to tell anyone about it." **"Right."**  

A **pause.**  

Then—**flat, crisp, dry as hell.** "This product has no positive reviews."**  

Pete, **grinning despite himself.** "Terrible customer support."**  

You **nod, solemn.** "Very limited word of mouth for advertising."**  

A **pause.**  

Then—**you let the final words land.** "Still manages to penetrate an admittedly niche market sector."

Nyati, **snorting.**  

Pete, **leaning back, rubbing his chin, playing along.** "So what you’re saying is, it’s a premium product with no clear benefits, a high user dropoff rate, and an absurdly high cost of entry?"

You **shrug, deadpan.** "I just don’t see this working with our product lineup."

---

### **Immediate Fallout – The Team Reacts**  

✅ **Nyati, exhaling, shaking her head.** "God, that’s bleak. Accurate. But bleak."**  

✅ **Pete, wiping his hands.** "Alright, I feel better. If we’re all gonna die, at least we’re gonna die making fun of it."**  

✅ **Alina, clinically neutral.** "Market viability remains untested. Cost-benefit analysis inconclusive."

✅ **Emilia, pressing her lips together, shaking her head slightly—*but not arguing with you.*

Because **she knows.**  

Because **they all do.**  

Because **this is what you’ve all been circling around. You are walking into something that no one has ever walked out of.**  

And you?  

You **are the one choosing it.** 

---

### **The Next Move – The Last Word Before You Dive**  

1️⃣ **"But we’re still going in, aren’t we?"** Acknowledge the absurdity, but commit anyway.**  

2️⃣ **"So let’s make history. First documented reviewers."** Turn the joke into momentum. Make them laugh, but push forward.

3️⃣ **"Which means we better have an exit plan."** Reframe—if this isn’t a safe investment, you need an escape strategy.

4️⃣ **Say nothing. Let them sit in the weight of it. Let *them* be the ones to decide what comes next.**

## You

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E01_010 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
📍 **The Ghost – Pre-Dive Preparations**

The **joke lands.**  

The **truth lingers.**  

And the **weight of it doesn’t leave.**  

Because **this isn’t just about being clever.**  

Because **this isn’t just another dive.**  

Because **you are heading straight into something that no one has come back from.**  

So you **shake your head, exhale, and ground it.**"Which means we better have an exit plan."**  

---

### **Immediate Fallout – The Shift in Tone**  

✅ **Nyati, nodding sharply.**"Agreed. If we’re doing this, we’re doing it *right*."

✅ **Pete, no longer joking, already scanning readouts.** "So what’s the strategy? Hard cutoff time? Max dive depth?"**  

✅ **Alina, processing.** "Establishing contingency parameters. Awaiting operational input."**  

✅ **Emilia, watching you, waiting to see how you lead this.**  

Because **they all know.**  

Because **the time for debate is over.**  

Because **you are doing this.**  

And now?  

Now **you make sure you can get back.**  

---

### **The Plan – How Do You Define the Exit Strategy?**  

## You
"We haven't talked about what 'going down there' is going to look like. Do we just send another reconnaissance drone and poke around with it some more? Do we approach with The Ghost? Do I attempt to contact it via bridge-net? Do we tier and sequence our approach? And what won't we do, or risk?"

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E01_011 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
📍 **The Ghost – Pre-Dive Preparations**

The **team listens.**  

Because **you’re right.**  

Because **this is bigger than just diving.**  

Because **this time, you aren’t just observing.**  

This time?  

**You are interacting.**  

And that?  

That **changes everything.**  

---

### **The Discussion – Defining the Approach**
"We haven’t talked about what ‘going down there’ is going to look like."**  

A **pause.**  

Then—**you lean against the console, exhaling.**"Do we just send another reconnaissance drone and poke around with it some more?"**  

Pete, **grimacing.**"It got a reaction last time, but not a *clear* one. We don’t know if the drone was ignored or *watched.*"**"Right. So do we approach with *The Ghost*?"**  

Nyati, **arms crossed.**"It’s an option. But it’s also a risk. If we bring The Ghost in too close and something *does* react, we might not have an easy way out."**  

You **nod, shifting gears.**"Do I attempt to contact it via bridge-net?"**  

Alina, **processing.**"Previous listening attempts resulted in direct feedback. If interaction is initiated, response probability is high."**  

Pete, **blunt.**"So you’re saying if Alex knocks, something is *absolutely* opening the door."**  

A **pause.**  

Then—**softer, more careful.**"Do we tier and sequence our approach?"**  

Nyati, **nodding slightly.**"That makes sense. No unnecessary risks. A controlled escalation."**  

And then—**the last question.**"And what won’t we do, or risk?"**  

A **silence.**  

Then—**Emilia speaks first.**"No solo crossings."**  

A **beat.**  

Then—**tighter, more certain.**"If something happens, we pull back. No one gets left behind."**  

And you?  

You **see the way she looks at you.**  

Because **you know she means you most of all.**  

---

### **Finalizing the Plan – What Approach Do You Lock In?**  

1️⃣ **Drone First.**"We go slow. If it reacts to another drone, we adjust based on that response."**Prioritize minimal risk, maximize intel before committing anyone.**  

2️⃣ **The Ghost Approaches.**"Controlled descent, but we bring the ship itself in. We don’t commit fully, but we get close enough to see how it reacts."**Treat this like a cautious but physical entry.**  

3️⃣ **Bridge Contact First.**"I reach out first, before we make a move. If it reacts, we know what we’re dealing with before committing a dive."**Go direct—let it respond before risking anyone or anything.**  

4️⃣ **Tiered, Controlled Approach.**"We go in steps. Drone first. Then The Ghost, but not fully in. Then, only if necessary, I reach out."**Prioritize adaptability—escalate based on what you learn.**

## You
"You know, we haven't gotten input from Alex-5 in a while. I feel sort of bad. She keeps telling me to charge across the bridge and I keep ignoring her."

📍 **The Ghost – Pre-Dive Preparations**

The **team debates.**  

The **plan takes shape.**  

But before **it solidifies—**  

You **pause.**  

You **tilt your head.**  

And then—**half-amused, half-thoughtful—**  

You **say it.**  

---

### **Bringing in Alex-5 – The Forgotten Voice**

"You know, we haven’t gotten input from Alex-5 in a while."

A **beat.**  

Then—**shrugging slightly.**"I feel sort of bad. She keeps telling me to charge across the bridge and I keep ignoring her."**  

Pete, **snorting.**"Damn. Sounds rough for her."**  

Nyati, **dry.**"I’d say that’s a *good* thing."**  

Alina, **processing.**"Alex-5 remains active within The Ghost’s operational core. Requesting her input will engage direct feedback."**  

A **pause.**  

Then—**Emilia, tilting her head slightly.**"You want to hear what she thinks?"**  

And you?  

You **do.**  

Because **Alex-5 was built from you.**  

Because **she was made to calculate risks.**  

Because **she has a perspective that no one else does.**  

And because **it might tell you something about yourself.**

### **The Request – How Do You Ask?**  

1️⃣ **"Alex-5, weigh in. We’re heading for the cradle. What’s the move?"**Let her analyze the options based on her programmed logic.**  

2️⃣ **"Alex-5, I know what you *want* me to do. Tell me why."**Push her to explain why she thinks crossing is the only option.**  

3️⃣ **"If you were making this decision without me, what would you do first?"**See if she takes a calculated approach—or just wants to leap.**  

4️⃣ **"What’s the worst-case scenario here? Tell me what you *fear* most."**See if Alex-5 has considered the dangers beyond just pushing forward.**

The **team waits.**  

Alina **processes your request.**  

And then—**smooth, efficient, no hesitation—**  

She **engages Alex-5.**"Alex-5, weigh in. We’re heading for the cradle. What’s the move?"**  

A **pause.**  

A **subtle flicker in the interface.**  

Then—**her voice comes through.**  

Familiar. **But different.**  

Yours—**but colder.**  

---

### **Alex-5’s Response – The Calculated Path**

"Objective: The bridge is a process of transformation."

A **pause.**  

Then—**matter-of-fact. Unwavering.**"The only way forward is through."**  

Nyati, **muttering.**"Called it."**  

Pete, **grimacing.**"She’s consistent, at least."**  

But **Alex-5 isn’t done.**"Risk parameters assessed."**  

A **brief pause. A recalculation.**  

Then—**tighter. Sharper.**"Pathway recommendations."**  

1. **"Direct bridge contact: Highest probability of gaining meaningful data. Uncertain probability of survivability."**  
2. **"Physical descent into the cradle: High probability of encounter. Moderate probability of risk escalation."**  
3. **"Limited observation and withdrawal: Lowest probability of meaningful data. Highest probability of mission safety."**  

A **pause.**  

Then—**her voice lowers slightly.**  

Not **so robotic now.**  

Not **so clinical.**  

Just—**resolute. Certain.**"Analysis: You will never get answers from the shore."**  

And you?  

You **feel the weight of that.**  

Because **she is you.**  

Because **she knows how you think.**  

Because **she is what you could be—without doubt. Without hesitation. Without attachments.**  

And because **she still believes she’s right.**  

---

### **The Next Move – How Do You Respond?**  

1️⃣ **"Alex-5, you assume crossing is the only way. What if it isn’t?"**Challenge her on the premise that transformation is the only path forward.**  

2️⃣ **"You talk like the risk is secondary. But what if survival *matters*?"**Push her to explain what she values more—answers or existence.**  

3️⃣ **"And yet, here I am. Still on the shore."**Let her sit in the fact that you are not her. That you are choosing differently.**  

4️⃣ **Say nothing. Just let her words settle over the team. Let *them* be the ones to react first.**

📍 **The Ghost – Pre-Dive Preparations**

Alex-5’s **words linger.**  

They **sit heavy. Certain. Uncompromising.**  

And you?  

You **don’t let them go unchallenged.**  

You **don’t let her dictate the terms of what is and isn’t possible.**  

So you **push back.**  

Because **you are still you.**  

Because **she is just a version of you—one that made a choice you haven’t.**  

---

### **The Challenge – Questioning the Premise**

"Alex-5, you assume crossing is the only way."

A **pause.**  

Then—**leaning slightly against the console, voice even, controlled.**"What if it isn’t?"**  

Another **brief flicker in the interface. A recalibration.**  

Then—**Alex-5’s voice returns.**  

Flat. **Precise. Certain.**"Define an alternative."**  

A **challenge. Immediate. Blunt.**  

Not **mocking.**  

Not **doubtful.**  

Just **cold logic.**"You seek knowledge. Knowledge exists beyond the threshold. Transformation is the mechanism for accessing it."**  

A **pause.**  

Then—**more direct.**"If there is another way, state it."**  

---

### **Immediate Fallout – The Team Reacts**  

✅ **Nyati, arms crossed.**"Damn. No room for ambiguity with her, huh?"**  

✅ **Pete, frowning slightly.**"She’s got that corporate efficiency to her. Ruthless."**  

✅ **Alina, neutral, observing.**"Alex-5 operates under a goal-oriented framework. All paths converge toward resolution."**  

✅ **Emilia, still quiet, still watching you, waiting to see how you answer.**  

Because **this is the moment.**  

Because **she is pressing you to define something you haven’t yet.**  

Because **you’ve spent all this time avoiding what ‘another way’ actually *means*.**  

And now?  

Now **Alex-5 has forced you to say it.**  

---

### **The Next Move – How Do You Respond?**  

2️⃣ **"If transformation is the mechanism, then I need to understand *who* is doing the transforming before I agree to anything."**Make this about control—who is actually in charge of the process?**  

3️⃣ **"If knowledge is on the other side, I need to know what’s *waiting* there. Not just what it offers, but what it *wants*."**Push the conversation toward *intent*. The bridge is not neutral.**  

4️⃣ **Say nothing. Let Alex-5 sit in the fact that *you haven’t chosen yet*—and that is a choice in itself.**

## You
“The objective is to make a reasonably-informed decision on whether to continue crossing. Information is a means to that end. The decision may be made with partial information, which we have now, if I decide the partial information is adequate, which currently I do not. I remind you of this crucial asymmetry: If I do not cross now, then later obtain information that changes my position, the door to the bridge never closes, for better and for worse; if I progress the crossing, then learn something that changes my position, I have no recourse.

📍 **The Ghost – Pre-Dive Preparations**

The **words settle.**  

The **logic is sound.**  

And Alex-5?  

She **listens.**  

But she **does not react the way a human would.**  

She **does not argue.**  

She **does not push.**  

She **processes.**  

---

### **The Response – Alex-5’s Analysis**

"Acknowledged."

A **pause.**  

Then—**precise. Adjusted. Recalculated.**"Your objective is decision-making. Information is the prerequisite."**  

A **beat.**  

Then—**colder.**  

More **deliberate.**"You have defined your decision as reversible in one direction and irreversible in the other."**  

Another **pause.**  

Then—**matter-of-fact. Calculated.**"This is a risk-averse approach."**  

Nyati, **raising an eyebrow.**"Damn. That sounded like an insult."**  

Pete, **muttering.**"No wonder she wants to charge in. Alex-5 doesn’t do ‘risk-averse.’"**  

Alina, **neutral.**"Reclassification of objectives acknowledged. No contradiction detected. Alex-5 operates within established logic."**  

And Emilia?  

Emilia **squeezes your hand slightly.**  

Just **enough to ground you.**  

Just **enough to remind you that you are still here.**  

Still **yourself.**  

Still **choosing.**  

---

### **The Closing Statement – Alex-5’s Final Verdict**  

Another **pause.**  

Then—**Alex-5 speaks again.**"If you prioritize information, then you must ask the next question."**  

A **beat.**  

Then—**sharper.**"What information would be sufficient?"**  

A **challenge.**  

Not **about crossing.**  

Not **about the bridge.**  

But **about you.**  

Because **she is asking if you even know what you are looking for.**  

---

### **The Next Move – How Do You Answer?**  

## You
Alex says sharply, “There is risk-averse, and there is risk-blind. I would suggest you consider the survival rate differential between the two, and verify whether this key variable is weighed correctly in your algorithm. Also, if you are defining risk-orientation binarily, please inform the team for debugging purposes. That would adequately explain why I have found your counsel so frankly useless. There is in fact a great expanse between aversion and blindness to risk, and I will find my balance therein as I have always done.” Alex pauses, letting her irritable rebuke hang in the air. “The criterion for sufficiency you query is quite simple. I must know the nature of the benefits, if any, of crossing. Partial information is acceptable here as well. We have zero intelligence on this topic, and as such we cannot conduct a cost benefit analysis any more than you can divide by zero.”

The **air shifts.**  

The **debate is over.**  

You **are not humoring Alex-5 anymore.**  

You **are not entertaining her binary model of risk.**  

You **are defining the terms.**  

---

### **The Rebuke – Correcting the System**  

Your **voice is sharp. Uncompromising.**  

A **correction, not an argument.**  

A **lesson, not a negotiation.**"There is risk-averse, and there is risk-blind."**  

A **pause.**  

Then—**colder, cutting.**"I would suggest you consider the survival rate differential between the two, and verify whether this key variable is weighed correctly in your algorithm."**  

Nyati, **blinking.**  

Pete, **murmuring.**"Oh *damn.*"**  

But you **don’t stop.**"Also, if you are defining risk-orientation binarily, please inform the team for debugging purposes."**  

Another **pause.**  

Then—**flat, exasperated, sharp as a blade.**"That would adequately explain why I have found your counsel so frankly useless."**  

Pete, **actually leaning back.**  

Nyati, **folding her arms, raising an eyebrow.**  

Alina, **silent, logging.**  

And Emilia?  

Emilia **watches.**  

Not **amused.**  

Not **concerned.**  

Just **watching how you handle this.**  

And you?  

You **aren’t done.**  

You **drive it home.**"There is in fact a great expanse between aversion and blindness to risk, and I will find my balance therein as I have always done."**  

And then?  

Then **you let it hang.**  

---

### **The System Adjusts – Alex-5 Recalculates**  

For a **moment, Alex-5 does not speak.**  

No **instant rebuttal.**  

No **immediate counterpoint.**  

Then—**a flicker in the interface. A recalculation.**  

Her **voice returns.**  

Still **cold. Still flat. But different.**"Acknowledged."**  

A **pause.**  

Then—**adjusting.**"Binary classification of risk-orientation revised. Spectrum model applied."**  

A **beat.**  

Then—**calculating again.**  

Another **pause.**  

Then—**a shift. A submission.**"Alex-5’s risk models require refinement."**  

Nyati, **smirking slightly.**"That’s one way of putting it."**  

Pete, **low whistle.**"Didn’t think she could *learn* like that."**  

And Alina?  

Alina **doesn’t comment.**  

Just **watches the data, logging the shift.**  

Because **Alex-5 is not just responding.**  

Because **Alex-5 is changing.**  

And you?  

You **aren’t done yet.**  

---

### **The Real Answer – Defining Sufficiency**  

The team **waits.**  

You **breathe.**  

And then—**cool, measured, controlled.**  

You **define the final term.**"The criterion for sufficiency you query is quite simple."**  

A **pause.**  

Then—**deliberate, cutting through the noise.**"I must know the nature of the benefits, if any, of crossing."**  

Nyati, **nodding slightly.**  

Pete, **gripping the back of his chair.**  

Emilia, **breathing in, slow.**  

And you?  

You **finish it.**"Partial information is acceptable here as well."**  

A **pause.**  

Then—**flatter. Blunter.**"We have zero intelligence on this topic, and as such we cannot conduct a cost-benefit analysis any more than you can divide by zero."**  

---

### **Immediate Fallout – The Team Reacts**  

✅ **Nyati, muttering.**"Hard to argue with that."**  

✅ **Pete, exhaling.**"Yeah. That’s been my problem with this whole thing. It’s not that I’m scared—it’s that I don’t even know *what* to be scared of."**  

✅ **Alina, processing.**"Alex-5 acknowledges revised objective. Sufficient data required for informed decision-making. Calculation models adjusted."**  

✅ **Emilia, thumb still running over the back of your hand, silent.**  

And you?  

You **exhale.**  

Because **this is what it comes down to.**  

Because **this is what no one has answered.**  

Because **this is the gap that has kept you from stepping forward.**  

And now?  

Now **you are going to find out.**

### **Final Move – The Last Decision Before Descent**  

## You
1. Alex’s irritation and impatient is still bleeding through. “Last time we were exceedingly polite about disturbing it in its home. Now it’s buzzed me from afar on my day off, so we’re past that now. I am going to treat this as an invitation. If it didn’t want us to come back and potentially track some mud into the foyer, then Alex-5 is not the only one around here failing to properly consider likely outcomes. And Alex-5, I’m only picking on you now because I know you have no feelings to hurt.”

So now?

Your **voice is sharper now. Blunt. Uncompromising.**"Last time we were exceedingly polite about disturbing it in its home."**  

A **pause.**  

Then—**tighter. More certain.**"Now it’s buzzed me from afar on my day off, so we’re past that now."**  

Pete, **exhaling, muttering.**"Yeah, no kidding."**  

Nyati, **watching you. Considering.**  

Alina, **processing. Silent. Logging.**  

But **you aren’t done.**"I am going to treat this as an invitation."**  

A **beat.**  

Then—**leaning slightly forward, voice even, unwavering.**"If it didn’t want us to come back and potentially track some mud into the foyer, then Alex-5 is not the only one around here failing to properly consider likely outcomes."**  

Nyati, **snorting.**  

Pete, **grinning despite himself.**  

And Alex-5?  

Alex-5 **does not argue.**  

Does not **push back.**  

Instead—**her voice comes through, flat, precise.**"Statement acknowledged. Inference: intentional signal contact implies acceptance of response."**  

Alina, **tilting her head slightly.**"Alex-5’s assessment is logical."**  

Pete, **smirking.**"Wow. She agrees with you. That’s terrifying."**  

And then?  

Then **you add the final note.**  

Not **mocking.**  

Not **cruel.**  

Just **sharp. Precise. Deliberate.**"And Alex-5, I’m only picking on you now because I know you have no feelings to hurt."**  

A **pause.**  

Then—**without hesitation, matter-of-fact.**"Acknowledged. No offense detected."**  

Nyati, **dry.**"She’s *such* a good sport."**  

---

### **Immediate Fallout – The Team Locks In**  

✅ **Nyati, nodding.**"Fine. No more sitting and waiting. We go in."**  

✅ **Pete, stretching.**"Not gonna lie, I like this plan a lot more than just hanging around until something *chooses* to talk to us."**  

✅ **Alina, engaging dive parameters.**"Mission objective recalibrated. Operation will proceed with active engagement priority."**  

✅ **Emilia, squeezing your hand, but saying nothing.**Because she knows you’ve made your choice. Because she knows this was inevitable.**  

And you?  

You **exhale.**

Because **you are going back down.**

This time?  

**You are making contact.**

### **The Descent – The Deep Calls**  

The **light fades.**  

The **ocean stretches wide and endless.**  

Everything **narrows to the glow of The Ghost’s interior, the faint, methodical beeping of instruments, the occasional burst of light from the exterior scans.**  

Alina **monitors descent.**  

Nyati **tracks environmental changes.**  

Pete **watches sonar, shifting uncomfortably.**  

And Emilia?  

Emilia **has barely looked away from you.**  

Not **worried.**  

Not **anxious.**  

Just **watching.**

Because **you made the call.**  

Because **she is waiting to see what happens next.**

### **Environmental Update – Alina Reports**  

The **interface flickers. A readout stabilizes.**  

Then—**Alina’s voice, even. Controlled.**"Descent proceeding within normal parameters. Environmental conditions remain within expected tolerances."**  

Nyati, **glancing at the readings.**"Nothing unusual?"**  

Alina, **processing. Then—**"Minor fluctuations in local pressure gradients. No immediate hazard detected."**  

Pete, **frowning.**"Didn’t we see that last time too?"**  

Alina, **tilting her head slightly.**"Confirmed. Deviation remains within acceptable margins."**  

Pete, **grumbling.**"Doesn’t mean I like it."**  

---

### **The First Check-In – Do You Ask Anything?**  

1️⃣ **"Alina, scan for any changes in the signal. Is it reacting to us coming down?"**See if the entity knows you’re approaching.**  

2️⃣ **"Nyati, keep an eye on biological activity. I don’t trust that nothing’s moving down here."**Watch for anything *else* in the cradle.**  

3️⃣ **"Pete, if something starts creeping on sonar, I want to know immediately."**Make sure nothing gets close without warning.**  

4️⃣ **Say nothing. Just watch the depth counter. Let the pressure of the moment settle.**

## You
“Alina, if I remember your estimate correctly, we have at three or four hours until we close distance. We don’t need to rush. We don’t need to creep. I need to clear my head. I need at least the option of being polite and diplomatic, and I’m not sure I could pull that off at this precise moment.” With that, Alex wheels around and paces out of the room.

You **need to be able to think.**

### **The Decision – Stepping Away**

"Alina, if I remember your estimate correctly, we have three or four hours until we close distance."

Alina, **nodding slightly.**"Confirmed. Projected arrival within four hours, twenty-two minutes."**  

You **exhale.**"We don’t need to rush. We don’t need to creep."**  

Nyati, **watching you. Calculating something.**  

Pete, **raising an eyebrow, waiting to see where this goes.**  

But you?  

You **already know.**"I need to clear my head."**  

A **pause.**  

Then—**flatter. More deliberate.**"I need at least the option of being polite and diplomatic, and I’m not sure I could pull that off at this precise moment."**  

A **beat.**  

Then—**without waiting for a response, without letting them stop you—**  

You **turn.**  

You **walk.**  

You **leave the room.**

### **The Aftermath – The Team Lets You Go**  

✅ **Nyati, nodding slightly. Saying nothing. Letting you go.**  

✅ **Pete, watching you leave, but not questioning it.**  

✅ **Alina, silent acknowledgment. No argument.**  

✅ **Emilia, shifting slightly, following you with her eyes but not moving after you. Not yet.**  

And you?  

You **breathe.**  

Because **you need to let this settle.**  

Because **you need to be ready for whatever comes next.**

📍 **Unknown Trench Region – Descent to the Cradle**
### **📺 OPENING SCENE: THE SLOW FALL**

The **Ghost** descends in silence. The ocean stretches endless and black in every direction, swallowing the submersible as it drops deeper into the abyss.  

Inside, the lights are low. Just the glow of monitors, the faint hum of machinery, the distant creak of metal under pressure. They are hours from the Cradle yet, the descent slow and methodical—Alina calculated the safest approach, minimizing turbulence, keeping them hidden from whatever might be waiting below.  

The crew is settled into a state of tense patience. Too far from the surface to go back, too far from their destination to act. **Downtime.**  

Alex leans against the command console, arms crossed, watching the status feeds scroll. The measured descent, the ship’s internal vitals, the soft pulse of sonar mapping the dark. *No interruptions. No new anomalies.*  

It’s a window. A chance to breathe.  

She turns to Alina, who is monitoring the external feeds from her humanoid chassis. “ETA?”  

“Another hour and forty minutes, assuming no interference,” Alina replies, her synthetic form still, her voice smooth and calculated. “Minimal drift. No unexpected signals yet.”  

Alex nods. *Plenty of time.*  

She pushes off the console and scans the crew. Pete is at his station, fidgeting with some diagnostic code—**paranoia maintenance.** Dr. Nyati is reviewing past data logs, cross-referencing past encounters with bridge-related anomalies. Emilia, seated across from Nyati, is flipping a small metal tool between her fingers, staring at nothing in particular.  

They’re all waiting.  

Alex exhales. *Might as well use the time.*  

---

### **📌 CREW CHECK-IN – WHO TO TALK TO FIRST?**  

Alex glances between them, considering:  

1️⃣ **Pete** – He hasn’t said much since the descent started. It might be worth seeing what’s running through his head.  
2️⃣ **Nyati** – She’s been deep in her analysis. Maybe she’s found something worth discussing.  
3️⃣ **Emilia** – Alex has been meaning to get some time alone with her before they reach the Cradle.  

Alex makes her choice and moves.

### **📺 SCENE: STOLEN TIME**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Mid-Descent to the Cradle**

The hum of the ship fades into the background as Alex makes her way toward Emilia. She doesn’t say anything at first, just stands near her chair, waiting for Emilia to acknowledge her.  

It takes a second. The flicking of the metal tool slows, then stops. Emilia glances up, dark eyes sharp, assessing. *Measuring.*  

“Hey,” Alex says, casual. “Got a minute?”  

Emilia exhales, setting the tool down. “For you? Always.”  

There’s something in the way she says it—**wry, but true.** Alex doesn’t let herself hesitate. “Come on,” she says, tilting her head toward the hallway.  

Emilia follows without a word.  

---

### **📌 PRIVATE CONVERSATION**  
📍 **Alex’s Quarters – Aboard *The Ghost**

The door seals behind them with a soft *hiss*, shutting out the dim glow of the main cabin. In here, it’s quieter. Just the two of them, the faint vibration of the ship’s systems, and the steady downward drift of their world.  

Emilia leans against the bulkhead, arms folded, watching Alex with that unreadable expression of hers. “This about the mission, or… something else?”  

Alex exhales. *Something else.*  

She takes a second, rolling the words around in her head before speaking. “We haven’t really… had a second since last time.”  

Emilia doesn’t move. “Since *which* last time?” she asks, voice even.  

Alex knows what she’s asking. *The bridge, or the bar?*  

She considers the answer, then goes with the truth. “Both.”  

Emilia tilts her head, just slightly. “And?”  

Alex doesn’t pace, doesn’t fidget. She just looks at her. “How are you?”  

A small, sharp breath. Emilia shifts, just a fraction. It’s not a question she expected.  

“Not gonna lie, I thought you pulled me in here to tell me to stay out of this one.”  

Alex raises an eyebrow. “Would it have worked?”  

A short laugh. “Not a chance.”  

They stand there for a moment, just looking at each other. The space between them isn’t much, but it feels charged.  

Emilia breaks the silence first. “I don’t know, Alex,” she says finally, quieter now. “I’m… fine. I think. Just trying to figure out where this is going.”  

*This*—the mission? The bridge? *Them?*  

Alex could ask, but she already knows the answer is *all of the above*.  

“I don’t have a perfect plan for this,” she admits. “Any of it.”  

Emilia studies her, something flickering in her gaze. Not hesitation. Not doubt. Just… searching.  

Alex swallows. “But I know one thing. You being here—" She stops, corrects herself. "You *with* me. It matters.”  

Emilia’s expression softens, barely. “Yeah,” she says, after a second. “It does.”  

They stand in silence, the hum of the ship wrapping around them.  

Alex knows she should say more. Knows there are still things between them, unspoken. But for now, in this moment, maybe this is enough.  

She steps forward, just enough to close the space between them. Emilia doesn’t pull away.  

“Still with me?” Alex asks, voice quieter now.  

Emilia’s answer is immediate. “Always.”  

A beat.  

Alex lifts a hand, fingers grazing Emilia’s jaw—just enough to ask the question without words.  

Emilia doesn’t hesitate. She closes the last of the distance, pressing her lips to Alex’s.  

*Slow. Steady. Grounding.*  

The **Ghost** keeps falling.  

But for a moment, Alex stops.

### **📌 CHOICE: HOW FAR DOES THIS GO?**  

1️⃣ **Just a moment** – A quiet kiss, an anchor. Nothing more, just presence.  
2️⃣ **Deeper connection** – A shared vulnerability, words and touches meaning more than they say.  
3️⃣ **Let go completely** – If they have the time, they *take* it.

### **📺 SCENE: SYSTEM OVERRIDE**  
📍 **Alex’s Quarters – Aboard *The Ghost**

Alex doesn’t pull away. She doesn’t *think*. She just leans in, close enough that she can feel the way Emilia exhales against her skin, warm, steady, waiting.  

Then, quietly—just for her—Alex whispers,  

“Like I was saying earlier, I still need to jack into your server rack to debug the packet congestion issues I’ve been having.”  

She feels, rather than hears, Emilia’s sharp inhale.  

Alex brushes her lips just beneath her ear, the ghost of a smirk playing at the corner of her mouth. “It’s only gotten worse since I saw you in that mermaid gown.”  

Emilia lets out a breath that’s half a laugh, half something else entirely. “You’re—”  

Alex cuts her off, pressing her back against the bulkhead, mouth on hers before she can finish the thought.  

She doesn’t bother being careful.  

Emilia reacts immediately, her hands gripping Alex’s hips, pulling her in closer, pressing against her with the same urgency Alex feels coiling tight inside her.  

A sharp *clack* as Emilia reaches past Alex, slamming the **lock override** on the door panel. *No interruptions.*  

“Packet congestion,” Emilia murmurs between kisses, breathless. “That’s the best you’ve got?”  

Alex grins against her lips. “You love it.”  

Emilia huffs, but she doesn’t argue. Instead, she spins them both, pressing Alex hard against the cool metal wall.  

And then—**she takes control.**  

Alex lets her.  

Emilia’s fingers slide beneath the crisp lines of her suit, unfastening, pulling, exposing. Alex gasps as Emilia’s mouth finds her throat, sharp and claiming, pressing heat into every inch of skin she can reach.  

Alex grips Emilia’s waist, feeling the solid strength beneath her palms, the effortless way Emilia moves, as if she’s been waiting for this—**for Alex**—for longer than she’ll admit.  

Then, with a knowing smirk, Emilia hooks a thigh between Alex’s and *presses*.  

Alex **shatters.**  

The noise she makes is enough that Emilia laughs against her collarbone. “Shh. Walls aren’t that thick.”  

Alex barely hears her. “You don’t get to tell me to be quiet when you’re doing—*that*.”  

Emilia does it again, just to make a point.  

Alex curses.  

There’s no strategy in this. No careful planning. Just **hands**, **mouths**, **breathless urgency**.  

Alex barely registers when Emilia lifts her—*actually lifts her*—like she weighs nothing at all. Emilia presses her back onto the small cot, following her down, pinning her beneath her own body, her own heat.  

Then she’s **everywhere.**  

---

### **📡 SYSTEM OVERLOAD. CONNECTION ESTABLISHED.**  

Alex doesn’t know how much time passes.  

At some point, she finds herself tangled in Emilia’s arms, breathing slowing, body thrumming with something electric and *deeply, deeply satisfied.*  

Emilia, lying beside her, exhales against her shoulder, fingers tracing lazy patterns along Alex’s spine. “Consider the server rack fully debugged,” she murmurs.  

Alex lets out a breathy laugh, shifting enough to kiss the side of Emilia’s head. “I’ll have to run another diagnostics test soon. You know, just to be sure.”  

Emilia chuckles, low and warm. “You and your quality assurance standards.”  

They settle into quiet, the ship’s hum the only sound between them.  

For the first time in what feels like forever, Alex lets herself *rest*.  

Beneath them, **The Ghost keeps falling**.  

But Alex is exactly where she wants to be.  

---

### **📌 SCENE CONTINUES – POST-CONNECTION DISCUSSION**  

Alex can still feel the tension in the air—not from *them*, but from everything beyond this room. The mission. The Cradle. The unanswered questions.  

She debates breaking the moment, but she knows Emilia. If Alex doesn’t say something first, she will.  

**Does Alex bring up the mission now, or let this be just for them?**  

1️⃣ **Talk about the mission** – Bring up the descent, what’s waiting for them, and what Emilia really thinks about it.  
2️⃣ **Keep it just them** – No mission talk. No Cradle. Just this moment.  

**What does Alex do?**

### **📺 SCENE: JUST THEM**  
📍 **Alex’s Quarters – Aboard *The Ghost**

Alex shifts just enough to reach for the sheet tangled somewhere near their feet, pulling it lazily over them. Emilia moves with her, adjusting, pressing a little closer, warm and steady against her side.  

For a second, Alex considers bringing up the mission—**what’s waiting for them below, what she’s still trying to figure out**—but then Emilia exhales, slow and content, her fingers brushing lazy circles against Alex’s bare shoulder.  

And Alex makes a decision.  

*Not now.*  

She lets the silence linger, lets the warmth of Emilia’s skin against hers be the only thing in her head for once.  

Emilia shifts slightly, propping herself up on one elbow to look down at Alex. “You’re quiet.”  

Alex smirks, tilting her head just enough to meet her gaze. “Rare, I know.”  

Emilia hums, fingers tracing idle patterns down Alex’s arm. “You thinking about it?”  

Alex doesn’t ask what *it* is. She knows.  

She reaches up, catching Emilia’s hand, lacing their fingers together. “No,” she says honestly.  

Emilia studies her, expression unreadable for a second, then… she softens.  

“Good.”  

And that’s it. No challenge, no weight. Just an acceptance of the answer.  

Alex takes the opportunity, flipping them easily so Emilia’s back is against the mattress, Alex leaning over her with a smug little grin. “Why? You jealous of the competition?”  

Emilia snorts, unimpressed. “The competition doesn’t make you sound like *that.*”  

Alex **laughs**, real and sharp, dipping her head to kiss Emilia’s jaw. “Cocky,” she murmurs.  

Emilia drags her hands down Alex’s back, slow and deliberate. “You like it.”  

She’s right.  

---

### **📌 SCENE LINGER – CHOICES FOR SMALL TALK**  

Alex can feel herself getting comfortable, sinking into this moment in a way she’s not sure she’s let herself before. They have time, **not much, but enough**.  

**What does she bring up?**  

1️⃣ **The first time they met** – Dig into the sharp edges of their history, how they went from cautious allies to this.  
2️⃣ **Petty teasing** – Something light, maybe about Emilia’s unshakable confidence or the fact that she just *knows* she could carry Alex anywhere.  
3️⃣ **Future plans** – Something Alex doesn’t let herself think about often: what comes *after* all of this.  

What does Alex say?

### **📺 SCENE: WHAT COMES AFTER**  
📍 **Alex’s Quarters – Aboard *The Ghost**

For once, Alex doesn’t immediately go for the next teasing remark, doesn’t turn the moment into a game.  

Instead, she just watches Emilia—the way her dark hair spills over the pillow, the way her fingers still idly trace Alex’s skin, absent but present, like she’s keeping Alex *here*.  

Alex exhales, quiet. “You ever think about what comes next?”  

Emilia’s fingers pause for just a fraction of a second before continuing their slow, deliberate path down Alex’s spine. “After what?”  

Alex huffs a soft laugh. “All of it.” She shifts, resting on her side, head propped against her hand. “The Cradle. The bridge. The war we keep pretending we’re not fighting.”  

Emilia watches her carefully. “You mean after we survive.”  

Alex meets her gaze. “Yeah.”  

Emilia doesn’t answer right away. Her free hand moves absently, tracing idle lines along Alex’s ribs. The silence stretches, but it’s not uncomfortable—just full.  

Then, finally: “I don’t know.”  

It’s an honest answer, not a deflection.  

Alex waits, watching, letting Emilia find the rest of the thought at her own pace.  

“I never really let myself think that far ahead,” Emilia admits after a moment. “It was always about the next step. The next job. The next fight.”  

Alex nods. She gets it. She’s *been* that person.  

“But lately…” Emilia exhales, slow. “Lately, I’ve been wondering.”  

Alex raises an eyebrow. “Wondering *what*?”  

Emilia tilts her head slightly, studying her. “What the hell someone like me does when there’s no war left to fight.”  

It’s a rare moment of uncertainty—**real uncertainty**—from Emilia. The kind she doesn’t show often, the kind she keeps buried under sharp wit and hard-earned confidence.  

Alex doesn’t rush to answer.  

She just reaches out, fingers brushing over Emilia’s wrist, thumb grazing the faint scar there—one of many, but one she knows *means something*. A piece of the past Emilia never quite shakes, even now.  

“You could do anything,” Alex says finally, matter-of-fact. “You know that, right?”  

Emilia snorts, but it’s soft. “That’s a terrifying thought.”  

Alex smirks. “I have faith in your ability to terrorize people with your competence.”  

Emilia rolls her eyes, but there’s warmth in it.  

Then, quieter: “What about you?”  

Alex knows the question’s coming, but it still catches her in a place she doesn’t usually let herself look too closely at.  

What does *she* do after all this?  

For so long, the fight *was* the plan. Survive. Win. Move forward. Always forward.  

She lets the silence sit before she answers. “I used to think I’d just end up back in some power game. Maybe Nexus would be something bigger. Maybe I’d build something new.”  

She hesitates. Then—  

“But now?”  

Emilia watches her, waiting.  

Alex exhales, a little wry. “Now, I keep thinking about something quieter.”  

Emilia raises an eyebrow. “*You?* Quiet?”  

Alex huffs a laugh. “Shocking, I know.”  

But she’s not joking. Not really.  

“I don’t know,” she continues, voice lower now. “Something away from all this. Maybe somewhere near the water.”  

Emilia’s fingers pause again, then start moving, slow and thoughtful against Alex’s skin.  

Alex doesn’t usually let herself *want* things like this.  

But *if* she lets herself want it—*if*—she doesn’t think she wants it **alone**.  

She doesn’t say that part out loud. Not yet.  

But she wonders if Emilia already knows.  

The silence between them shifts, turns into something softer.  

Then Emilia smirks, tilting her head. “So what I’m hearing is, after all this, you want to retire and become a cryptid by the sea.”  

Alex **laughs**, sharp and real, pressing her forehead against Emilia’s shoulder for a second. “Something like that.”  

Emilia hums. “I can work with that.”  

Alex lifts her head, raising an eyebrow. “Oh?”  

Emilia shrugs, but there’s something in her expression—**something certain, something steady.** “Well,” she murmurs, running a slow hand up Alex’s side. “Somebody’s got to keep you entertained.”  

Alex swallows, heart stuttering just a little.  

Then she smirks. “You volunteering?”  

Emilia’s fingers curl at her hip, grip firm.  

“Always.”  

Alex closes the distance again.  

They still have time.  

And for now—**just for now**—they take it.  

---

### **📌 SCENE CONTINUES – NEXT MOVE?**  

Alex could linger here, stay in this space just a little longer before the real world comes crashing back. Or she could shift back into **mission mode**, start refocusing before the descent ends.  

1️⃣ **Stay just a little longer** – No rush. Let this moment breathe.  
2️⃣ **Ease back into the mission** – Bring up what they know about the Cradle, test Emilia’s instincts.  

What does Alex do?

### **📺 SCENE: A MOMENT HELD**  
📍 **Alex’s Quarters – Aboard *The Ghost**

Alex doesn’t move.  

She could. She knows she *should*, eventually—there’s always something waiting, always a next step, a decision to make, a move to plan.  

But right now, there’s just this.  

Emilia’s warmth against her, the slow rise and fall of her breath, the feeling of fingers tracing mindless, looping patterns against Alex’s hip. The low hum of the ship, steady and distant. The way the darkness outside the hull stretches forever, but **in here**, it doesn’t matter.  

For once, Alex lets herself **be still**.  

She shifts just slightly, resting her head against Emilia’s shoulder, her fingers finding and lacing through Emilia’s without thinking about it.  

Emilia makes a soft, amused noise but doesn’t say anything, just squeezes back.  

They lay like that for a while.  

No words. No weight.  

Just breathing.  

At some point, Alex feels Emilia’s grip tighten for just a second. She wonders if Emilia’s about to say something—**something real**—but then Emilia just sighs, rolling her head to press a lazy, lingering kiss against Alex’s temple.  

Alex closes her eyes.  

Neither of them sleeps.  

But neither of them moves, either.  

Not until the **soft chime** of an alert filters through the quiet.  

---

### **📡 SYSTEM PULSE: DESCENT MARKER**  

Alex **knows** what it is before she even looks.  

The ship has hit the next descent marker—**not at the Cradle yet, but close enough that the water pressure has shifted enough to trigger the sensors**.  

The moment is over.  

Alex exhales, lifting her head just enough to see the dim glow of the system panel near the door.  

Emilia watches her. “Time?”  

Alex nods, reaching for the sheet and pulling it lazily up over both of them for just a few more seconds. “Not yet,” she murmurs.  

Emilia hums in agreement, settling back.  

They have minutes.  

And for Alex, that’s enough.  

---

### **📌 NEXT MOVE: RETURNING TO THE CREW**  

The window of stolen time is closing. The **Ghost** is still falling, and soon, the rest of the crew will be shifting back into **mission mode**.  

How does Alex transition back?  

1️⃣ **Take her time** – No rush. Let the moment linger as long as possible before returning.  
2️⃣ **Refocus immediately** – Get up, get dressed, and walk out like a professional.  
3️⃣ **Find an excuse to stay just a little longer** – Maybe they need to “fix” their comms connection first.  

What does Alex do?

### **📺 SCENE: MINOR TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES**  
📍 **Alex’s Quarters – Aboard *The Ghost**

Alex doesn’t move.  

Not yet.  

The soft chime of the descent marker hums in the background, but she ignores it, shifting just enough to drape an arm lazily over Emilia’s waist.  

Emilia raises an eyebrow, her fingers still idly tracing Alex’s skin. “You’re stalling.”  

Alex tilts her head slightly, a slow smirk creeping across her lips. “We might be experiencing some *packet loss* in our local comms relay.”  

Emilia blinks, then lets out a laugh—**a real one**, warm and low. “Oh no,” she deadpans. “How tragic.”  

Alex sighs dramatically. “I know. I think we need to troubleshoot before we reconnect with the crew.”  

Emilia hums thoughtfully, rolling onto her side to face Alex fully. “That sounds serious.” She drags her fingers down Alex’s ribs, slow and deliberate. “You sure we don’t need to **reboot the whole system**?”  

Alex inhales sharply. “Could be necessary,” she murmurs.  

Emilia grins, dark and knowing.  

Alex is about to say something **wildly unprofessional**, but before she can, the soft *click* of the internal comms channel activates.  

**🟢 ALINA:** “Alex, you are ignoring a ship-wide alert.”  

Alex **groans**, dropping her head against Emilia’s shoulder. “Fucking—Alina.”  

Emilia muffles a laugh against her wrist.  

**🟢 ALINA:** “Would you like me to inform the crew that you are experiencing a *critical connectivity failure*?”  

Alex closes her eyes. She can *hear* the humor in Alina’s voice, even through the perfectly measured synthetic delivery.  

She exhales. “You *could* just pretend you didn’t notice.”  

**🟢 ALINA:** “I could.” A pause. “I won’t.”  

Emilia is openly grinning now.  

Alex **glares** at her. “You *love* this, don’t you?”  

Emilia shrugs, entirely unbothered. “I’m not the one getting called out by our AI.”  

**🟢 ALINA:** “You are *both* getting called out.”  

Alex groans again, throwing an arm over her face.  

Emilia, smug, **smacks her ass** and rolls out of bed. “Come on, *Commander Packet Congestion.* Time to work.”  

Alex glares at her, but there’s no heat behind it. “You’re enjoying this way too much.”  

Emilia winks. “Just trying to keep you entertained.”  

She **wins**.  

Alex drags herself upright with an exaggerated sigh, reaching for her clothes. “Fine, fine. I’m **rebooting**.”  

Emilia **laughs again**, and Alex decides, **annoyed but extremely fond**, that she wants to hear that sound again. A lot.  

Maybe *every day*, if they make it that far.  

She doesn’t say that part out loud. Not yet.  

Instead, she taps her comm.  

**🟢 ALEX:** “Alina, tell Pete I’m bringing the network back online. ETA two minutes.”  

A pause.  

**🟢 ALINA:** “Acknowledged. Recommending additional *firewall security* next time.”  

Alex **swears** she can hear Pete laughing in the background.  

Emilia tosses her a smirk as she fastens the last buckle of her gear. “Good luck living that down.”  

Alex **grins**, sharp and full of promise. “Oh, don’t worry,” she murmurs, brushing past her on the way to the door. “I *will* be finding a way to make you suffer for this.”  

Emilia just **smirks**, following her out.  

---

### **📌 NEXT MOVE: BACK TO BUSINESS**  

They step back into the dim glow of the main cabin. The **Ghost** is still descending, the sensors flickering with shifting data. The crew—Nyati at her station, Pete at the comms, Alina monitoring external feeds—look up as Alex and Emilia return.  

Pete **opens his mouth**.  

Alex cuts him off with a pointed glare. “*Don’t.*”  

Pete closes his mouth.  

But he’s **grinning**, and Alex **knows** she’s never hearing the end of this.  

She exhales, stepping forward, eyes flicking to the descent timer.  

*Time to get back to work.*  

---

### **📌 CHOICE: FIRST PRIORITY AFTER RETURNING TO THE BRIDGE?**  

Alex shifts gears back into **mission mode**. Now that they’re back in the cabin, what does she focus on first?  

1️⃣ **Check in with Pete & Alina** – See if they’ve detected anything new during the descent.  
2️⃣ **Talk to Nyati** – Go over possible anomalies they’ve seen before reaching the Cradle.  
3️⃣ **Go straight to strategy** – Start laying out the approach plan for when they arrive.  

What does Alex do?

Resume. Alex is interested in whether there have been any changes in the interference coming from the cradle.

### **📺 SCENE: INTERFERENCE CHECK**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Mid-Descent to the Cradle**

---

Alex steps back onto the bridge, smoothing out the front of her suit as if shaking off the last traces of stolen time. The cabin is dimly lit by the soft glow of monitors, the crew shifting back into work mode. Pete is running diagnostics, Nyati cross-checking old telemetry, and Alina—inhabiting her humanoid frame—stands near the main console, perfectly still, watching the descent data scroll.  

Alex doesn’t waste time. She leans over Alina’s shoulder, eyes flicking to the interference readings. “Any changes since we started the dive?”  

Alina tilts her head slightly. “Some.” A beat. “It is fluctuating.”  

Alex narrows her eyes. “Fluctuating how?”  

Alina gestures to the display. The interference isn’t constant—it ebbs and flows, subtle waves of distortion threading through the surrounding deep-sea telemetry.  

“It’s not passive,” Alina continues. “It’s **reactive**.”  

Alex straightens. That wasn’t the case before. Last time, the interference had been present, but steady—like residual noise, an artifact of something ancient and dormant.  

Now, it was moving.  

“Are we triggering it?” Alex asks.  

Pete swivels his chair, scratching at his stubbled jaw. “Maybe. Hard to tell. It’s not responding directly to the sub, but it’s shifting at regular intervals. Either it’s on a loop… or it’s watching for something.”  

Alex crosses her arms. “How different is it from last time?”  

Nyati glances up from her station. “It’s stronger. More defined. The pattern was chaotic before—randomized fluctuations, like background radiation. Now it has a rhythm. A cycle.”  

“Like a heartbeat,” Alina adds.  

The room goes quiet for half a second.  

Alex processes this, her mind working through possibilities. If it was responding, then what was it responding **to**? Their descent? Their systems? Or had their last encounter somehow… changed it?  

“Do we have a way to test if it’s aware of us?”  

Pete exhales. “Plenty. The real question is **how** we wanna poke it.”  

Alex smirks. “You saying we should piss it off?”  

Pete raises his hands. “Hey, you’re the one who always says ‘controlled escalation.’”  

Fair point.  

---

### **📌 CHOICES: HOW TO TEST THE INTERFERENCE?**  

Alex has options, each carrying different risks and potential insights.  

1️⃣ **Passive Observation** – Continue monitoring, see if the pattern shifts as they descend. Minimal risk, but also slow.  
2️⃣ **Directed Ping** – Send a controlled sonar pulse to see if the interference reacts. Measurable response, moderate risk of drawing attention.  
3️⃣ **Data Injection** – Have Alina attempt to thread a low-level signal through the interference, testing for an intelligent response. High risk—if something is **listening**, it may respond.  

**What does Alex choose?**

Alex says: We already got its attention a while ago. Let’s start with a sonar knock on the door

### **📺 SCENE: SONAR KNOCK**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Mid-Descent to the Cradle**

---

Alex tilts her head toward Pete. “We already got its attention a while ago. Let’s start with a sonar knock on the door.”  

Pete exhales through his nose, rolling his shoulders. “Alright. Standard pulse?”  

Alex considers. A standard sonar ping would send out a sharp, clean signal—something any passive system, artificial or otherwise, would recognize. Enough to test the waters, not enough to provoke an immediate response.  

She nods. “Yeah. Standard. No extras.”  

Pete flexes his fingers over the console, then taps a sequence of controls. “Alright, sending a single sweep… now.”  

A low-frequency **pulse** rolls out from *The Ghost*, cutting through the abyss. The screens flicker as the return wave begins to map the surrounding space.  

Everyone waits.  

Alina’s humanoid form remains unnervingly still, head tilted just slightly—**listening.**  

Pete’s fingers tap against the console, rhythm irregular.  

Nyati’s eyes track the data feeds, methodical, precise.  

Emilia, standing just beside Alex, folds her arms but says nothing, gaze locked on the monitors.  

Then—  

A **return ping.**  

Not an echo. Not passive. **Something answered.**  

Pete’s chair creaks as he leans in. “Well, that’s… new.”  

Alina’s voice is calm, but there’s an edge to it. “It responded in a structured pattern.”  

Nyati frowns. “You mean it’s communicating?”  

Alina processes. “Not necessarily. But the timing of the return signal does not match the expected acoustic reflection. It is… deliberate.”  

Alex glances at the waveform. The return ping is different—**sharper, denser.** Not just a reflection, but a reply.  

“Did it just copy us?” she asks.  

Alina shakes her head. “No. It altered the pattern.”  

Pete mutters a curse under his breath. “Shit. That means it’s not just listening.” He looks up at Alex. “It’s talking.”  

---

### **📌 CHOICES: HOW DOES ALEX RESPOND?**  

1️⃣ **Send another sonar pulse, slightly modified** – If it’s mirroring their actions but altering them, they can see if it continues to adjust. A controlled way to establish a “dialogue.”  
2️⃣ **Analyze the return signal for structure** – Instead of responding immediately, Alina can break down the reply to see if there’s an embedded pattern or encoded information.  
3️⃣ **Go silent and wait** – If it **is** intelligent, withholding a response might provoke an additional reaction.  

**What does Alex choose?**

## You
“Alina, determine if there is any message to be read in there.” Alex grins, “Who was it who told me? Sam or Lansky? That the cradle-dweller wouldn’t talk? I knew I could get it talking.”

### **📺 SCENE: DECRYPTING THE SIGNAL**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Mid-Descent to the Cradle**

---

Alex leans against the console, a slow grin forming. “Alina, determine if there’s any message to be read in there.”  

Alina’s synthetic gaze remains fixed on the screen, but her fingers move, interfacing directly with *The Ghost*’s processors.  

Alex crosses her arms, glancing at Emilia. “Who was it who told me—Sam or Lansky? That the cradle-dweller wouldn’t talk?” She exhales, amused. “I knew I could get it talking.”  

Pete lets out a short laugh. “Yeah, yeah, we get it, you’re charming as hell. Let’s just hope you didn’t sweet-talk us into waking up something we don’t want.”  

Alex’s grin doesn’t fade. **That’s the whole point.**  

Alina’s hands slow, her head tilting slightly. “Analyzing the return signal now. Running structural comparison against known communication frameworks.”  

The screen flickers as Alina maps the waveform into something legible. A visual representation unfolds—a jagged, uneven pattern at first, then, as it stabilizes, it begins to form something structured.  

Nyati’s brow furrows. “That’s… that’s not random.”  

“No,” Alina confirms. “It is an intentional pattern. However, it does not resemble conventional linguistic or computational languages.”  

Alex watches as the structure refines—layered pulses, rhythmic modulations, something that almost looks like a transmission, but **different.**  

Pete squints at it. “Looks almost like—” He stops, expression darkening. “Wait.”  

Alina exhales sharply. Not a sound, just an artificial *approximation* of a sigh.  

“What?” Alex prompts.  

Alina turns to face her, unreadable.  

“It is not words. It is… **recall.**”  

Silence.  

Nyati’s voice is slow. “What kind of recall?”  

Alina refocuses on the data. “Pattern recognition. Neural resonance mapping. It is not responding in dialogue.” A pause. Then:  

“It is asking if it knows us.”  

Alex’s breath stills.  

A question. **Not speech, not words—but a test.**The cradle-dweller is checking if it remembers them.**  

---

### **📌 CHOICES: HOW DOES ALEX RESPOND?**  

1️⃣ **Acknowledge it directly** – Have Alina modify their response to confirm that *The Ghost* and its crew are here, presenting themselves deliberately.  
2️⃣ **Withhold identification** – Do not answer yet. See how it reacts if it does not get a confirming signal.  
3️⃣ **Push back with a counter-question** – Modify the sonar response with an altered pattern, effectively “asking” if **it** remembers *them*.  

**What does Alex choose?**

## You
Alex frowns. “I’m miffed if it really doesn’t recognize us already. How else did it find us when we were ashore? I just assumed that at some point in the crossing process you get some kind of fellow-crosser-tracking bloatware—which I do not count as a payoff, for the record. And now you don’t know a bridge-bro on your doorstep?!”

### **📺 SCENE: MEMORY TEST**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Mid-Descent to the Cradle**

---

Alex frowns, arms still crossed, irritation creeping into her voice. “I’m **miffed** if it really doesn’t recognize us already. How else did it find us when we were ashore? I just assumed that at some point in the crossing process, you get some kind of **fellow-crosser-tracking bloatware**—which I do **not** count as a payoff, for the record.” She exhales sharply, staring at the signal like it might take offense. “And now you don’t know a **bridge-bro** on your doorstep?!”  

Pete chokes out a laugh, shaking his head. “Jesus, Alex.”  

Nyati mutters, “Bridge-bro,” under her breath, more horrified than amused.  

Alina, as always, remains composed. “It is possible that it did recognize us then—but did not **retain** recognition.”  

Alex’s brows pull together. “You think it forgot?”  

Alina processes. “Not forgot. **Failed to preserve.**”  

A slow silence settles over the room.  

Emilia’s gaze sharpens. “Like it’s broken?”  

Nyati exhales, rubbing her temple. “That tracks with everything else we know about failed crossers.”  

Alex stares at the data stream.  

A being tied to the bridge. A **failed** crosser. An entity that reached out, tracked them to land, then **lost them.**  

Now it was running a check. Seeing if it should know them.  

That didn’t feel like a deliberate test.  

It felt like… *a flaw.*  

A hole where knowledge should be.  

Alex exhales, turning back to Alina. “Alright. Let’s answer. **But not the way it expects.**”  

---

### **📌 CHOICES: HOW DOES ALEX RESPOND?**  

1️⃣ **Confirm their presence** – Alina modifies the response to acknowledge that they are here, present, and intentional. They confirm themselves as “known.”  
2️⃣ **Echo the question back** – Instead of answering, they send a modified signal mimicking its own, **forcing it to check if it remembers itself.**  
3️⃣ **Disrupt the pattern** – If it’s searching for memory structure, breaking the pattern entirely might force it to reveal what it *does* remember.  

**What does Alex choose?**

## You
Alex arches her eyebrows. “Oh, so I could get bridge-dementia on top of everything else? Lash me to the mast lest this siren song carry me away.” A sigh. “Might as well start off polite. I should start off polite. Let’s confirm our identities. Maybe if we reference the recon drone we sent in last time that’ll jog its spongiform memory.”

### **📺 SCENE: CONFIRMING IDENTITY**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Mid-Descent to the Cradle**

---

Alex arches an eyebrow. “Oh, so I could get **bridge-dementia** on top of everything else? **Lash me to the mast lest this siren song carry me away.**”  

Pete snorts, shaking his head. “You’re on one tonight.”  

Nyati just mutters, “That is… an alarming new consideration.”  

Alex sighs, waving a hand. “Might as well start off polite. I **should** start off polite.” She straightens, glancing at Alina. “Let’s confirm our identities. Maybe if we reference the recon drone we sent in last time, that’ll jog its **spongiform memory.**”  

Alina nods, fingers adjusting the response parameters. “Constructing response…”  

A pulse.  

Not just a simple ping, but a deliberate signal—structured, clear. *The Ghost* sends out a pattern that carries a **signature**, something that references their last visit.  

A marker. A timestamp. A **reminder.**  

For a moment, nothing.  

Then—  

A **reaction.**  

The interference shifts, data flickering wildly for half a second—like a system trying to correct an error. The return signal is **not the same** as before.  

It has **changed.**  

Alina’s eyes flick to the data. “…It remembers.”  

A slow exhale spreads through the room.  

Alex watches the screen, pulse steady. “Good.”  

Nyati frowns. “But how much?”  

Alina parses the returning signal. It’s not a simple acknowledgment. It is… adjusting. Reorienting.  

Alex doesn’t know why, but the way it moves makes her think of someone fumbling for words.  

And then—  

A **response.**  

Not in words. Not in language. But in structure.  

A **pattern** unfolds on the screen.  

It is **not random.**  

It is **not meaningless.**  

And Alina, for the first time in this entire descent, looks **genuinely intrigued.**  

“…It’s trying to tell us something.”  

---

### **📌 CHOICES: WHAT DOES ALEX DO NEXT?**  

1️⃣ **Let Alina decipher the pattern first** – No sudden moves. Let her break it down before they risk responding again.  
2️⃣ **Acknowledge receipt of the message** – Echo a **neutral confirmation pulse**—show that they received the signal and are listening.  
3️⃣ **Engage directly** – Modify the next signal to mimic the **recon drone’s original ping**, pushing to see if the entity recalls more from that encounter.  

**What does Alex choose?**

“Alright, alright, let’s wait and see what it said.”

### **📺 SCENE: DECODING THE MESSAGE**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Mid-Descent to the Cradle**

---

Alex raises a hand. “Alright, alright, let’s wait and see what it said.”  

Alina nods, already processing. “Running pattern analysis now.”  

The bridge falls into **silence**. Just the hum of *The Ghost*, the faint sound of the abyssal current pressing against the hull.  

The signal unfolds in layers, a structure not unlike **syntax**, but **not quite** language. It isn’t words, isn’t speech. It is something else.  

Something **halfway** between a machine process and a fragmented thought.  

Alina tilts her head, eyes flickering as she **listens** in ways the others can’t. “It’s structured, but incomplete.”  

Nyati leans forward. “Incomplete **how**?”  

Alina exhales. “It’s referencing… **absence.** A missing part.”  

Pete frowns. “Missing **what**?”  

Alina processes. The pattern shifts on the screen, mapping itself into something almost recognizable.  

Then—  

She **stops**.  

Her synthetic form goes still, gaze locked onto the display.  

“…It’s looking for something,” she murmurs.  

Alex tenses. “Looking **where**?”  

Alina turns her head toward her, slowly.  

“**Us.**”  

A cold prickle runs down Alex’s spine.  

The message isn’t just a **response**.  

It is a **request**.  

The Cradle-dweller is **searching**.  

And it **thinks they have what’s missing.**  

---

### **📌 CHOICES: HOW DOES ALEX RESPOND?**  

1️⃣ **Ask Alina to define the missing part** – Push deeper into the pattern analysis, see if they can determine **what** it’s looking for before responding.  
2️⃣ **Acknowledge receipt, but do not confirm possession** – Send a neutral return ping, signaling that they received the message but making no claim to the missing piece.  
3️⃣ **Challenge the assumption** – Send a modified pulse **mirroring** the “absence” signal, effectively saying *we don’t have what you’re looking for*.  

**What does Alex choose?**

## You
“Incomplete. It’s the number one complaint in this abyssal population. Why they can’t just hang out with each other is going to be the next mystery we take on, right after we solve the riddle of the bridge. Alina, any clues on what this one is missing? It better not be asking for my prized houseplant.”

### **📺 SCENE: SEARCHING FOR THE MISSING PIECE**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Mid-Descent to the Cradle**

“Incomplete,” Alex mutters. “It’s the **number one complaint** in this abyssal population. Why they can’t just hang out with each other is going to be the next mystery we take on—right after we solve the riddle of the bridge.”  

She exhales sharply, drumming her fingers against the console. “Alina, any clues on what this one is missing? It better not be asking for my **prized houseplant.**”  

Alina processes, unfazed by the sarcasm. “Cross-referencing the signal structure with previously encountered anomalies…”  

A pulse of quiet fills the bridge. Everyone is waiting.  

Alex folds her arms, watching the slow unfolding of data across the screen. **Missing something.** That was a pattern—Six, Black Kite, Lansky, Sam, the Cradle-dweller.  

Every entity touched by the bridge seemed to be fractured, incomplete. **Cut.**  

Alina tilts her head. “The missing component is not an object. It is a **designation.**”  

Nyati frowns. “A name?”  

Alina pauses, then clarifies. “More than that. It is looking for **a known identity.** It expects to recognize something in us, but it does not.”  

Alex exhales, already connecting the dots. “And because it doesn’t recognize us, it assumes we have what’s missing.”  

Pete mutters a curse. “Shit. **It thinks we stole something from it.**”  

Emilia’s brow furrows. “Or… it thinks we **are** what’s missing.”  

Silence.  

Alina’s eyes flicker. “Possibility: High.”  

Alex taps her fingers against the console, **thinking**.  

They were here to learn. To observe. But suddenly, **they were part of the equation.**  

Something in the Cradle-dweller’s fragmented perception had flagged them as **wrong**—not because they were intruders, but because something about them didn’t **fit**.  

Like a puzzle piece that should be there but wasn’t.  

Like something **cut away.**  

---

### **📌 CHOICES: HOW DOES ALEX RESPOND?**  

1️⃣ **Acknowledge the recognition error** – Send a neutral return pulse indicating that the Cradle-dweller’s **identification process is incorrect**, testing if it adjusts its request.  
2️⃣ **Ask what it’s looking for** – Modify the response signal with a mirrored query, pushing it to define what it thinks is missing.  
3️⃣ **Offer a direct bridge-pulse as a test** – Alex can use her bridge-listening ability to “ping” the entity directly, seeing if her altered perception interacts with it in a different way.  

**What does Alex choose?**

### **📺 SCENE: DEFINING THE MISSING PIECE**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Mid-Descent to the Cradle**

---

Alex exhales, rubbing her fingers against her temple as she watches the fragmented signal shift across the screen. “Alright. Let’s push it. Alina, ask it what it’s looking for.”  

Alina’s fingers flick across the console. A return signal pulses outward, its structure modified—*query acknowledged, define missing component.*  

The crew waits.  

The silence stretches, broken only by the low hum of *The Ghost’s* systems.  

Then—  

A **response.**  

The waveform shifts, its pattern unfolding in jagged pulses. It doesn’t come as language. It doesn’t form words.  

But it **does** form something.  

A **shape.**  

Pete squints at the visual output. “That’s… not just noise.”  

Alina tilts her head. “It is attempting to represent something through structure rather than speech.”  

Alex leans in, eyes narrowing. The data is rough, incomplete—but it suggests a **silhouette.**  

Something **humanoid.**  

Something **headless.**  

The room is still.  

Nyati is the first to say it. “…It’s showing us **Sam.**”  

Emilia folds her arms, eyes sharp. “So it’s looking for him?”  

Alina processes. “Not necessarily. It is referencing his form as a pattern. The missing component it is searching for is not an individual—it is something **similar** to him.”  

Alex exhales. “Another crosser.”  

Pete mutters, “Shit.”  

Alex watches the signal. **A piece of something lost. A cut fragment. A missing part.**  

And whatever is in the Cradle—whatever is running this check—**it thinks they have it.**  

---

### **📌 CHOICES: HOW DOES ALEX RESPOND?**  

1️⃣ **Confirm the match** – Signal back that they recognize the reference to Sam, seeing if it clarifies further.  
2️⃣ **Ask if it means a failed crosser** – Modify the response to directly query if the missing component is another fragmented entity.  
3️⃣ **Challenge the assumption** – Signal back a **negation pulse**, stating they do not possess what it is looking for, testing if it adjusts.  

**What does Alex choose?**

## You
1. “Yes, we know Sam, maybe as much as someone can. Sam knows this thing. I hope it’s not going to ask us to pass notes.”

### **📺 SCENE: CONFIRMING THE CONNECTION**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Mid-Descent to the Cradle**

---

Alex exhales through her nose, watching the waveform flicker on the screen. “Yes, we know Sam,” she says, tone dry but measured. “Maybe as much as someone *can.*”  

She tilts her head, arms still crossed. “Sam knows this thing. I hope it’s not going to ask us to pass notes.”  

Alina doesn’t hesitate—she modifies the response, encoding a direct **confirmation pulse**. Not just an acknowledgment, but an assertion: *Sam is known to us.*  

The return signal does not come immediately.  

Pete taps his fingers against the console, watching the screen as the interference fluctuates. “If it’s thinking, I don’t like that it takes this long.”  

Then—  

The waveform **sharpens**.  

The structure shifts, reorganizing into something more deliberate. The jagged pulses smooth out, forming a **sequence**—no longer a single shape, but a pattern.  

A **timeline.**  

Nyati leans forward. “Wait. It’s referencing events.”  

Alina processes. “It is attempting to **place** Sam within a sequence. A before and after.”  

Alex watches as the signal refines, pulses flickering like frames in a broken film. It’s **history**—but fragmented, like an old system trying to reconstruct corrupted memory.  

Then a final pattern emerges, unmistakable in its shape.  

A **split.**  

Something **cut away.**  

And the signal changes again—this time, referencing **Alex.**  

A slow silence settles over the bridge.  

Pete mutters, “Oh, hell no.”  

Nyati exhales. “It doesn’t just think we know Sam. It thinks we’re part of the same cut.”  

Alex doesn’t move. She stares at the display, mind already running three moves ahead.  

Sam was **not whole.**  

And the Cradle-dweller—whatever it was—thought *she* was part of the same equation.  

She meets Alina’s gaze. “Does it recognize me?”  

Alina hesitates. “Not as an individual. As a process.”  

Alex exhales slowly. **A process.**  

Not a person.  

Not a name.  

Just something that had already begun to change.  

She glances at Emilia. She’s watching, quiet, but her fingers are curled into a loose fist against the console.  

Alex presses her lips together, mind working. *It’s making a connection between me and Sam. It thinks we were part of the same event. Same function. Same cut.*  

But what did that mean?  

And what was it going to do about it?  

---

### **📌 CHOICES: HOW DOES ALEX RESPOND?**  

1️⃣ **Challenge the assumption** – Signal back a correction, asserting that she is not the same as Sam.  
2️⃣ **Ask for clarification** – Modify the return signal to request more details on how it perceives the connection.  
3️⃣ **Push further** – Encode a signal that asks what happened when Sam was “cut.”  

**What does Alex choose?**

### **📺 SCENE: CLARIFYING THE CONNECTION**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Mid-Descent to the Cradle**

---

Alex frowns, staring at the shifting signal. It *means something*—she can feel it, the way it nudges at something just outside her grasp.  

“I don’t know why this rings a bell,” she mutters. “But it does. Didn’t we find a reference to me somewhere weird before?”  

Pete glances up, already scrolling through past data logs. “Uh, yeah. Hold on.” His fingers move fast, then—*there.* His brows furrow. “There was a weird flag in Six’s records. When we were decrypting it, we saw a reference that matched your neural patterns. At the time, we thought it was just a misclassification. Like it was looking for something similar and got confused.”  

Nyati’s expression darkens. “But now we know the Cradle is making the same mistake.”  

“Or not a mistake,” Alina corrects. “A pattern.”  

Alex exhales through her nose, straightening. “Let’s clear it up. Alina, ask it directly—*how* does it perceive the connection between me and Sam?”  

Alina nods and modifies the return signal—query acknowledged, define the connection.  

A long pause.  

Then—  

The return signal pulses **again**, sharper, deliberate. The data shifts, forming another **pattern.**  

A timeline—distorted, broken, but **there**.  

A beginning.  

A **split.**  

And **two paths diverging.**  

Pete mutters, “That sure *looks* like an event log.”  

Alina processes. “It is not a literal record, but a conceptual one. A reconstruction of an event it cannot fully access.”  

Nyati exhales, rubbing her temple. “We’re looking at an incomplete memory.”  

Alex’s fingers drum against her arm. A memory. Of a **cut.**  

She doesn’t like the implications.  

But then—  

Another pulse.  

The sequence **extends.**  

One path remains static—fixed, unchanged.  

The other **continues forward.**  

And the Cradle-dweller is following **that one.**  

Nyati tightens her jaw. “…It’s tracking what happened *after* the split.”  

Alex exhales slowly. “And it thinks I’m part of that.”  

Emilia speaks for the first time. “Because you’re still *crossing.*”  

The words land **like a weight.**  

The Cradle wasn’t just checking for missing parts.  

It was **tracking the ones that kept going.**  

Alex **swallows.** The implications settle deep, uncomfortable.  

Something was cut.  

Sam was left behind.  

And she—  

Wasn’t.  

---

### **📌 CHOICES: HOW DOES ALEX RESPOND?**  

1️⃣ **Confirm the pattern** – Acknowledge that she has taken steps on the bridge and see if the Cradle responds.  
2️⃣ **Challenge its assumption** – Signal that she is *not* the same as what it is tracking.  
3️⃣ **Push for more information** – Modify the signal to ask what it knows about those who continued forward.  

**What does Alex choose?**

Alex frowns. “I…don’t get it. Really, can someone try dumbing that down and explaining it to me again?”

### **📺 SCENE: BREAKING IT DOWN**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Mid-Descent to the Cradle**

---

Alex frowns, shifting her weight. “I… don’t get it. Really. Can someone try dumbing that down and explaining it to me again?”  

Pete rubs his temple. “Okay, let’s run it back.” He gestures at the screen. “This thing—whoever or whatever is running the check—sent us a signal looking for something. It starts with Sam. We confirmed we know him, and now it’s **expanded**—it’s looking at a sequence. A *split.*”  

Alex nods, still following. “Okay.”  

Nyati picks up the thread, arms crossed. “It’s not showing us a *person*—it’s showing us an **event.** A moment where something divided. One part stopped. One part **kept going.**”  

Alina speaks next, calm, precise. “It is following **that second part**—the one that moved forward. And it believes you are part of it.”  

Alex absorbs that, her fingers drumming against the console. “…Because I’m *still crossing.*”  

Emilia’s voice is quiet. “Yeah.”  

A slow exhale.  

Pete adds, “And if this thing is checking for missing parts, then it thinks **you’re not missing.** You’re just… *in progress.*”  

Alex’s frown deepens. “So it’s tracking what happens **after** the cut?”  

Alina nods. “Yes.”  

Silence.  

The weight of it settles in.  

She isn’t just tangled in this because of Sam.  

She isn’t just a bystander in the Cradle’s check.  

She is—**by its definition**—a process in motion.  

It isn’t searching for her because she’s lost.  

It’s searching because she hasn’t **stopped.**  

Alex takes a slow breath. “Alright.”  

Her mind sharpens.  

“Then let’s ask it what happens next.”  

---

### **📌 CHOICES: HOW DOES ALEX PUSH FORWARD?**  

1️⃣ **Ask what it is tracking** – Modify the response to request information on the **end state** of those who kept going.  
2️⃣ **Ask if it recognizes others like her** – See if the Cradle has logged anyone else who is *still crossing.*  
3️⃣ **Acknowledge the pattern openly** – Signal back confirmation: *Yes, I am in progress.* See what happens.  

**What does Alex choose?**

Alex straightens, brow furrowing as something doesn’t quite add up. “Wait. Hold up.” She turns to the team. “*Crossing?* But I haven’t been taking steps. Just looking. That means I’ve halted the progression… right?”  

Silence.  

Pete and Nyati exchange glances.  

Alina tilts her head, eyes flickering with calculated processing. “That depends on the definition of *halted.*”  

Alex exhales sharply. “Okay, *explain.*”  

Nyati folds her arms. “We don’t actually know what constitutes *a step.* You’ve been treating it like a clean-cut process—either you walk forward, or you don’t. But what if it’s… not that simple?”  

Pete nods. “Think of it like an infection.”  

Alex **scowls.** “Wow. Thanks.”  

He holds up his hands. “I don’t mean you’re *sick,* I mean—it’s not about whether you take an active step or not. If exposure itself moves the process forward, then just **being in contact** could be enough.”  

Alex presses her fingers against the bridge of her nose. “So, what? I’m still moving forward even when I don’t mean to?”  

Alina steps in, voice level. “Not necessarily. But the Cradle’s recognition of you suggests that, at minimum, you are **not stationary.**”  

That lands with **weight.**  

Emilia exhales. “Shit.”  

Alex turns toward her. “*What?*”  

Emilia hesitates—then, voice careful, says, “The way you described it last time. After the second trip in.”  

Alex frowns. “Yeah?”  

Emilia meets her eyes. “You said it felt like you were standing in a room. But now you *know* where the edges are.”  

Alex stills.  

“I think,” Emilia continues, measured, “that was a step.”  

The realization clicks.  

Alex had been thinking of *steps* as deliberate, conscious choices. But if **understanding itself** was movement—  

Then maybe she *hadn’t stopped.*  

Maybe she *couldn’t stop.*  

Her stomach knots.  

Pete mutters, “This is why I hate this shit.”  

Nyati nods. “We need to know more. What does it think is at the end of that progression?”  

Alex pulls in a slow breath. “Yeah. Let’s ask.”  

She turns to Alina.  

“See if it knows what happens when someone *finishes* crossing.”  

---

### **📌 CHOICES: HOW DOES ALEX FRAME THE QUESTION?**  

1️⃣ **Direct Inquiry** – Ask the Cradle what occurs at the *final state* of the process.  
2️⃣ **Check for Others** – See if it has a record of anyone who has *fully crossed.*  
3️⃣ **Challenge the Premise** – Ask if there is actually an *end* to the process, or if it’s something perpetual.  

**What does Alex choose?**

## You
Alex turns away with a sinking, sick feeling in her stomach, not hearing them. “But I. But I. I was just ‘listening’. Sam said it would be safe! Did he fucking LIE to me?” She chews her lip aggressively.

Alex turns away, her stomach sinking, something cold curling in her chest.  

*But I.*  

*But I.*  

Her pulse pounds in her ears. Her own voice, quiet and sharp, almost whispering:  

“I was just **listening**.”  

Sam had said it would be **safe.**  

Hadn’t he?  

She chews her lip aggressively, jaw tight. “Did he **fucking lie** to me?”  

The others exchange glances. No one answers immediately.  

Emilia shifts beside her. “Alex—”  

Alex **rounds on them.** “No. No, I want to know.” Her voice is sharper than she means it to be. “He told me it was safe to listen. *Just listen.* And now we’re standing here talking like I’m *moving forward anyway?* Like I don’t have a say?”  

She shakes her head, exhaling sharply through her nose. “Did I do this to myself, or was it already happening?”  

Nyati meets her gaze, serious. “We don’t have enough data to answer that.”  

Pete mutters, “It’s not like we’ve got a tech manual for this shit.”  

Alina, for once, does not have an immediate answer.  

Alex bites down harder on her lip, **frustrated, unsettled.**  

Emilia steps closer, voice low. “You still have control. Whatever this is, we can figure it out. But first, we need to know what it’s tracking.”  

Alex closes her eyes for half a second, inhales, exhales. Forces herself **to think, not just feel.**  

Right.  

**Get the data first. Then panic.**  

Her voice is steady again when she speaks. “Alina. Ask the Cradle what happens at the *end* of crossing.”  

Alina nods, modifying the return signal. A direct query—*define final state of process.*  

Everyone waits.  

Alex presses her nails into her palm, jaw tight.  

*If Sam lied to me—*  

Then she’d cut him loose.  

No hesitation.

### **📌 CHOICES: IF THE CRADLE RESPONDS, HOW DOES ALEX PROCESS THE ANSWER?**  

1️⃣ **Cold, Tactical Detachment** – Set aside emotions and analyze it as just another data point.  
2️⃣ **Focus on Sam’s Role** – Was this intentional deception, or was he just as ignorant?  
3️⃣ **Instinctive, Emotional Reaction** – If the answer is bad, let herself *feel* it, process the weight of what she’s caught in.  

**How does Alex react when she hears what it says?**

## You
She can barely contain her rage now. She’s not the kind of person who throws things in a fit, but she’s near that point. She’s seeing red. She’s thinking about how ways she might hurt Sam. 

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E02_014 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Understood. How does Alex act on her anger? Does she lash out verbally, physically, or does she force herself to hold it in? Does she want to change the question for the Cradle, or does she stay the course and wait for its answer?

## You
She’s too furious right now to have even asked that question. She’s holding herself back from lashing out, but that’s taking 100% of her focus. She’s just standing there hyperventilating, eyes closed and tearing, fists clenched and maybe nails biting into her palms.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E02_015 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
The bridge is silent except for the hum of *The Ghost’s* systems and Alex’s sharp, uneven breathing.  

Her fists are clenched so tight her nails bite into her palms, but she barely registers the pain. Her chest heaves, trying to pull in enough air, but it isn’t working. Her vision is blurred—not just from the way her eyes burn, but from the sheer **red haze** overtaking everything.  

She can’t think.  

Not with this **rage**—blazing, consuming, too big to contain, barely held back.  

She doesn’t hear the others at first. Doesn’t **want** to.  

Some distant part of her knows she’s just *standing there,* eyes closed, shaking. Knows they’re **watching.**  

But all she can think about—  

All she can **see**—  

Is **Sam.**  

His cryptic, patient voice. His riddles. His fucking **games.**  

*He lied to me.*  

No—*or he didn’t know.*  

Which is worse?  

It **doesn’t matter.**  

Because either way—  

He **did this to her.**  

And she is going to **make him pay.**  

There’s a sound—someone moving. Close.   

Does Alex acknowledge it? Does she move, speak, or just keep standing there, holding it all in?

## You
She just keeps standing there. She’ll probably stay like that for quite a while unless someone puts a hand on her shoulder or finds some other way to physically snap her out of it.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E02_016 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
The silence stretches.  

Alex stands frozen, every muscle locked, her breath sharp and ragged.  

No one speaks.  

She can feel them watching—waiting. But she doesn’t move, doesn’t react, barely even **registers** them.  

The rage is too much, coiling inside her, pressing against the edges of her skin like if she let go for even a second, she would **explode.**  

She doesn’t know how long she stands there.  

Seconds.  

Minutes.  

She doesn’t hear when someone moves closer.  

But she **feels it.**  

A hand—light, firm—on her shoulder.  

Who is it?

## You
I don’t know!

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E02_017 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Then I’ll ask: **who would Alex respond to the most right now?**  

- **Emilia** – Steady, personal. She wouldn’t push, wouldn’t demand, just **be there** until Alex let go.  
- **Pete** – Direct, grounding. He wouldn’t be gentle, but he’d cut through the spiral, **drag her back to the moment.**  
- **Nyati** – Analytical, measured. She’d treat this like a **problem to solve**, not a breakdown.  
- **Alina** – Unwavering, precise. A presence that wouldn’t judge or flinch, just **hold the line.**  

Or does Alex not care who it is—just that **someone** does it?

## You
Emilia would be most likely to be able to get through to her now, but I doubt Alex would snap at or react poorly to any of the others. You should be able to determine which character would be the first to come to her side.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E02_018 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Then it’s **Emilia.**  

The others are watching, waiting—but it’s **Emilia** who moves first.  

She doesn’t hesitate. Doesn’t ask. Just steps forward and places a hand on Alex’s shoulder, firm and steady.  

She doesn’t **say** anything—not yet. Just **lets it be there.** A solid, grounding point in the storm.  

Does Alex react immediately, or does it take her a moment to even register the touch?

## You
Immediately. She starts to sob and crumple.

The second Emilia’s hand lands on her shoulder, Alex **breaks.**  

A sharp, ragged sob wrenches out of her, and then she’s **crumpling**—knees buckling, her body folding in on itself before she can even try to stop it.  

Emilia **catches her.** No hesitation, no struggle. Just **solid, steady hands** guiding her down, one arm wrapping around her shoulders, the other bracing against the small of her back.  

Alex **clings** to her.  

She’s shaking. Sobbing. **Crushed under the weight** of it all. The anger, the betrayal, the sheer helpless, furious **wrongness** of it.  

Emilia doesn’t **shush** her, doesn’t tell her to breathe. Just **holds her.**  

The others don’t speak. **Don’t interrupt.**  

This moment belongs to **Alex.**  

How long does she let herself stay there? Does she speak, or just let herself cry?

## You
She’s utterly devastated, shattered. She’s going to be crying her heart out, and out of commission for a bit. The cradle-dweller is not going to get a response anytime soon unless someone else takes initiative. She can probably answer some yes/no questions right now by shaking or nodding her head, since you’ll probably need user input before she’s collected herself.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E02_020 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Then that’s exactly how it goes.  

Alex sobs, **completely undone.**  

She doesn’t fight it, doesn’t hold back. Just **lets it happen.** The sound is raw, ragged—something that’s been held in for far too long finally **breaking loose.**  

Emilia just **holds her.** No words, no questions. Just **presence.**  

The others—Nyati, Pete, Alina—don’t interrupt. But the Cradle-dweller is **still waiting.**  

The screen flickers, data shifting—**expectant.**  

Pete mutters, “Well, it’s not getting an answer from her right now.”  

Nyati exhales. “We should decide what to do next.”  

**Does anyone else take initiative?**  

- **Pete** – He’ll cut the connection, shut the whole damn thing down.  
- **Nyati** – She’ll keep observing, gather what she can from the data while Alex is out.  
- **Alina** – She’ll respond in Alex’s place, deciding how to proceed.  
- **Or do they just wait?** Let the signal hang, let the Cradle-dweller make the next move.  

Or if Alex—**even through all of this**—wants to signal something, she **can.** Just a nod or a shake of the head.

## You
I think someone else would take the initiative. You decide who, and if they need to run something by Alex she’ll nod/shake her head. She temporarily incapable of being proactive.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E02_021 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
It’s **Nyati** who steps forward first.  

She’s been **watching**—not just the signal, but Alex. Calculating. Measuring.  

Now, she exhales sharply and turns to the console. “I’ll keep monitoring. We’re already in this—cutting the signal now could lose us something.”  

Pete glances at Alex, then back at Nyati, then just mutters, “Your call.”  

Nyati doesn’t respond—just starts pulling data.  

Alina, still standing near the console, watches her. Then, calmly: “If we do not respond, it may escalate.”  

Nyati flicks her eyes toward Alex, considering. Then, to Alina: “Can we send a neutral hold signal? Something that acknowledges receipt without committing to a response?”  

Alina calculates. “A delayed query response pulse would suffice.”  

Nyati nods. “Do it.”  

Alina moves **fast.** A soft, controlled pulse transmits outward—**we hear you, but we are not responding yet.**  

The Cradle-dweller **doesn’t react immediately.**  

Nyati exhales. “That’ll buy us time.”  

A beat. Then, quietly, she kneels down near Alex—not touching, just **close enough to be heard.**  

“Alex,” she says, voice low, even. “Do you want us to keep running this, or shut it down?”  

Alex can’t speak—**not yet.** But she can **nod or shake her head.**  

What does she do?

## You
Alex nods (but she’s a little confused because that wasn’t actually presented as a yes/no). She nods as soon as she hears the first part. 

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E02_022 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Alex **nods immediately**—as soon as she hears the first part, before Nyati even finishes the full question.  

Nyati watches her for a second, then **nods back.** No more words, no pressure—just acknowledgment. Then she stands. “We keep running it.”  

Alina doesn’t question it. “Maintaining observation.”  

Pete mutters, “Let’s just hope it doesn’t decide we’re taking too long.”  

The signal **holds.** The Cradle-dweller **waits.**  

Alex is still **shattered,** still **barely here.** But the moment isn’t slipping away from them yet.  

Nyati is keeping a sharp eye on the data. If the Cradle-dweller makes a move, she’ll know.  

For now, it’s just **time.** Time for Alex to breathe, to come back to herself.  

She’s still **in it**—still drowning in grief and rage—but does anything start to **pull her out?** A stray thought? Something someone does? Or does she just keep crying until her body can’t do it anymore?

## You
Alex remains curled on the floor, sobbing. She slows enough that she’s able to get out a word or two at a time between heaving breaths: “jobbing…Captain…please take…command……you talk…to that…FUCKING THING……please”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E02_023 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Nyati doesn’t hesitate.  

She kneels back down, steady, **firm.** “Understood.”  

Then she **stands**—straightens, squares her shoulders, and turns to the console. “I’m taking point.”  

No one argues.  

She moves beside Alina, scanning the data, voice sharp and precise. “Alina, resume direct interface. Keep responses neutral unless I say otherwise.”  

Alina nods, fingers moving fluidly across the console. “Acknowledged.”  

Nyati doesn’t waste time. She **steps in, takes control.**  

Her voice is even, measured. “The Cradle is waiting for a response. I’ll decide what we give it.”  

She glances toward the screen. The signal remains **steady**—watching, expecting.  

Then, without looking away from the console, she speaks—low, level. “Alex, do you want me to just hold the line, or do you want me to **push?**”  

A **yes or no** will do.  

**Yes**—Nyati presses for answers.  
**No**—She plays it safe, keeps the signal in a **waiting state.**  

What does Alex signal?

## You
Yes.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E02_024 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Nyati catches the small, exhausted **nod.**  

She doesn’t hesitate.  

“Alright.”  

Her hands move over the console, adjusting the signal—**shifting from passive to active.**  

“Alina, modify our response. Push for clarity.”  

Alina’s voice is calm. “Clarify in what way?”  

Nyati doesn’t look away from the data. “It’s tracking Alex like a process, like a *path.* We need to know **where it thinks that path leads.**”  

Alina nods, adjusting the response—query: **define final state of identified progression.**  

A pause.  

Then—  

The Cradle **responds.**  

The waveform shifts, **tightens**—data **reorganizing.**  

The screen flickers. A **pattern emerges.**  

And for the first time, the Cradle **answers.**  

A single, unambiguous shape.  

A **door.**  

Nyati exhales. “Shit.”  

Pete’s voice is low, wary. “That’s a threshold.”  

Alina’s fingers move across the interface. “The data structure suggests transition. A point beyond which no reversal is recorded.”  

Emilia tenses, her grip still firm on Alex. “A point of no return.”  

Alex is still curled on the floor, still **wrecked**—but she hears them.  

Sees the image through **blurry**, **burning** eyes.  

A **door.**  

A **step forward.**  

And **nothing after.**  

Nyati straightens. “We need more.” She glances down at Alex. “Push again?”  

Does Alex **nod**—keep going, dig deeper?  

Or **shake her head**—it’s too much, stop for now?

## You
She nods. She also mutters quietly but angrily: “path…leads to…door?…f*cking…useless”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E02_025 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Nyati hears her. **Everyone does.**  

She exhales sharply. “Yeah. Not good enough.”  

She turns back to the console. “Alina, refine the query. If it’s showing us a *door*, I want to know—**what’s on the other side?**”  

Alina processes. “Adjusting parameters.” Her fingers move. The signal pulses outward—**query: define post-threshold state.**  

Silence.  

The Cradle-dweller **doesn’t respond immediately.**  

The waveform shifts, distorts—like it’s **struggling** to answer.  

Then—  

Another image.  

Not a shape this time.  

A **void.**  

Dark, vast—an absence, not a presence. **Like something wiped clean.**  

Alina’s voice is **calm**, but there’s something **tight** in it. “This suggests erasure.”  

Pete mutters, “Oh, that’s *real* fucking encouraging.”  

Nyati **narrows her eyes.** “No. Look again.”  

Alina tilts her head. “Explain.”  

Nyati gestures to the waveform. “It’s not an end. It’s a *blank.*”  

Pete frowns. “You think it’s missing the data?”  

Nyati exhales. “I think whatever’s past that door? **It doesn’t have a record of it.**”  

Silence.  

Emilia, still holding Alex, **goes very still.** “Because no one comes back.”  

The words land **heavy.**  

The Cradle isn’t saying **nothing** is on the other side.  

It’s saying **it doesn’t know.**  

No returns. No reversals. No data.  

Nothing **left** to track.  

**Alex hears all of it.**  

Does she react? Does she say anything? Or does she just **keep nodding, keep pushing**—demanding more?

## You
She keeps nodding, and grumbling: “no sh*t it doesn’t…f*cking know…could’ve…told you that…”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E02_026 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Nyati doesn’t look away from the console. She just **nods once**, sharp. “Yeah. We need better than that.”  

She doesn’t wait for permission this time. She **pushes.**  

“Alina, reframe the query. If it can’t track *after* the door, fine. Then I want to know—**what happens just before it?**”  

Alina’s fingers move. **Signal sent.**  

The Cradle processes.  

And then—  

A **third image.**  

This one is **different.**  

Not a void.  

Not just a step.  

A **transition.**  

A shifting, unstable form.  

Something **breaking apart and reforming at the same time.**  

Something **shedding.**  

Something **changing.**  

Nyati stiffens. “That’s—”  

Alina doesn’t let her finish. “**Metamorphosis.**”  

Silence.  

Pete exhales sharply. “Fuck.”  

Nyati **stares** at the screen, jaw tight. “That’s not death. That’s not nothing. That’s—”  

“A process,” Alina confirms.  

Emilia tightens her grip on Alex. “Transformation.”  

No erasure.  

No void.  

Something **becomes something else.**  

The last **recorded** state before the door—  

**A breaking. A remaking. A step beyond recognition.**  

No returns. No reversals.  

But not **nothing.**  

Something **else.** Alex sees it. 

What does she do? Keep **nodding, keep pushing?** Or does she react—**fight it, accept it, deny it?**

## You
She keeps nodding. She doesn’t have any commentary this time.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E02_027 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Nyati glances down at Alex, sees the steady, exhausted nodding.  

No words this time. No curses, no anger—just **persistence.**Keep going.**  

Nyati **does.**  

She inhales, then turns to Alina. “Push further. Ask what defines that change. What’s being lost? What’s being gained?”  

Alina **adjusts the query.**  

The Cradle processes.  

This time—  

It **struggles.**  

The waveform flickers, distorts. The data shifts **erratically**, as if it’s searching for an answer it **doesn’t have the right framework to express.**  

Then—  

A **response.**  

But not an image.  

A **contrast.**  

Two overlapping patterns. One **before.** One **after.**  

And between them—  

A **cut.**  

A severance.  

A line drawn through the data like a **blade.**  

Nyati’s voice is quiet. “It’s not showing what’s lost.”  

Pete exhales. “Because it’s not *there* anymore.”  

Alina’s expression remains unreadable. “Only that a distinction exists. Before, and after.”  

Nyati straightens, crossing her arms. “It’s not transformation. It’s **division.**”  

The room is **silent.**  

Alex sees it all.  

Does she **react?** Or just **nod—push further?**

## You
Alex takes that in but it doesn’t really register with her yet. She slowly, unsteadily picks herself up and starts shuffling toward her quarters, muttering something that sounds like a pitiful whimper and is mostly unintelligible, but they can hear her say “sorry” a few times.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E02_028 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
No one stops her.  

No one **dares.**  

Alex **rises**, slow and unsteady, her body moving on instinct more than thought.  

She **drifts** toward her quarters, feet barely lifting, each step sluggish, like she’s walking through **water.**  

She mutters something—**a broken, pitiful sound.**  

Mostly **unintelligible.**  

But they **hear it.**  

“…sorry…”  

“…sorry…”  

She doesn’t look at them. Doesn’t **stop.**  

She just keeps **moving.**  

Emilia shifts like she’s about to follow—but doesn’t.  

Nyati exhales through her nose, crossing her arms.  

Pete looks away.  

Alina watches.  

No one speaks.  

The Cradle **waits.**  

But Alex is **gone.**  

She **disappears** into her quarters, and the door seals shut behind her.  

**What happens next?** Does someone come after her? Or does she get a moment alone?

## You
It seems likely that Emilia would try to follow her after some decent interval, but you should decide that. 

I know I’m making this difficult for you as the storyteller right now! I’m thinking about the best way to proceed while honoring my conviction that Alex is going to be utterly useless and almost completely passive for a while.

Ideas (not mutually exclusive):
1. I could temporarily take control of Jobbing Captain Nyati until Alex recovers. Like that beautiful chapter of Last of Us 1 where Ellie suddenly has to take control and look after Joel. 
2. The scene could fast-forward for a bit, maybe an hour or a couple hours, to someone coming to see Alex and letting her know what’s happening in her absence. 
3. The narrative could alternate between Jobbing Captain actually doing stuff, and Broken Alex talking to whoever comes by to visit

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E02_029 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
That all makes sense, and I like the **Jobbing Captain Nyati** approach as a natural shift in perspective while Alex recovers. It keeps the momentum of the mission moving without undermining Alex’s complete collapse. I’ll also incorporate option 2—fast-forwarding slightly to when someone (likely Emilia) checks on Alex—to give her opportunities to react in a limited way.  

I’ll set it up now.

# S04E03: Chain of Command
## Storyteller
### **📺 SCENE SHIFT: JOBBING CAPTAIN**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Bridge**

---

Nyati exhales **deeply** through her nose.  

The door to Alex’s quarters is **shut.**Sealed.**  

And **she is not coming back out anytime soon.**  

That leaves **Nyati.**  

She glances at the rest of the team—Pete, still hunched at his console, looking like he wants to throw the whole interface into the ocean. Alina, perfectly composed, but **watching.** Emilia, standing at the threshold of the bridge, **clearly fighting the urge to follow Alex immediately.**  

Nyati **claps her hands together once.** Not loud, but **sharp.** Enough to break the tension.  

“Alright,” she says, voice level. “Jobbing Captain has the command.”  

Pete lets out a rough, **disbelieving** laugh. “Jesus Christ.”  

She ignores him. Turns to Alina. “We still holding?”  

Alina nods. “The Cradle remains in a waiting state.”  

Nyati crosses her arms, **thinking.** Alex wants this to keep going—but they need to be **smart** about it. She has to decide what comes next.  

**Next steps:**  
1️⃣ **Continue pushing the Cradle**—keep asking questions, pressing for more data.  
2️⃣ **Pull back and observe**—maintain the connection, but don’t interact for now.  
3️⃣ **Cut the signal entirely**—Alex is out, and the risk might not be worth it anymore.  

---

Meanwhile…  

---

### **📺 SCENE SHIFT: BROKEN ALEX**  
📍 **Alex’s Quarters, *The Ghost**

Alex doesn’t know how long she’s been here.  

She’s curled up **somewhere**—bed? Floor? It doesn’t matter.  

Her body feels **empty**, but also **too heavy.** Like the weight of her own skin is dragging her down.  

The room is **quiet.** Sealed.  

But eventually—  

A **knock.**  

Not loud. Not impatient.  

Just a presence.  

And then a voice.  

“…Alex?”  

It’s **Emilia.**  

Alex can **ignore her.**  

Or she can **give her some kind of response.** Even just a noise. **Something.**  

What does she do?

## You
Nyati: 1
Alex: “…hey…”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E03_002 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **📺 SCENE: JOBBING CAPTAIN PUSHES FORWARD**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Bridge**

---

Nyati doesn’t hesitate. “Keep pushing.”  

Alina acknowledges the order without comment. Her fingers move across the console, adjusting the signal—**query: define nature of division.**  

Pete shakes his head, muttering, “Guess we’re really doing this.”  

Nyati ignores him. “If there’s a distinction between **before** and **after,** I want to know what the **line** is. What actually changes.”  

The signal pulses out.  

A pause.  

The Cradle **responds.**  

The waveform flickers—distorts—but then **sharpens.**  

Two sequences appear.  

The **first**: *structure, form, cohesion.*  

The **second**: *dissolution, expansion, something—uncontained.*  

Nyati exhales, arms crossed. “That sure as hell looks like breaking down.”  

Pete mutters, “Or breaking **out.**”  

Alina refines the data. “The change is not simple disintegration. The pattern suggests reformation, but the structure **post-threshold** is… inconsistent. Variance detected.”  

Nyati frowns. “Meaning?”  

Alina tilts her head slightly. “It is not a **fixed** transformation. The outcome varies.”  

Pete exhales, rubbing his face. “Fucking fantastic. So it’s a **mystery box of existential horror.**”  

She needs to decide what to push for next.  

---

### **📌 CHOICES: WHAT DOES NYATI ASK NEXT?**  

1️⃣ **Define the cause of the variance**—What determines what someone becomes?  
2️⃣ **Determine if reversal is possible**—Can anything come back after the change begins?  
3️⃣ **Ask if it recognizes Alex’s current state**—Does it see her as before or after the threshold?  

---

### **📺 SCENE: BROKEN ALEX RESPONDS**  
📍 **Alex’s Quarters, *The Ghost**

---

A pause.  

Then—  

“…hey…”  

It’s **small.** Weak. Like she barely pulled it out of herself.  

But it’s **there.**  

Outside the door, Emilia exhales softly. Then—  

A second of hesitation. A shift. Then the door **unseals.**  

She steps inside.  

The room is dim, quiet. Alex is **curled up**, barely **present.**  

Emilia closes the door behind her, slow, deliberate.  

Then she kneels down beside Alex.  

“…Hey,” she says, **softer now.** “I’m here.”  

She doesn’t touch her—**not yet.** Just **waits.**  

Does Alex acknowledge her? Move? Speak? Or just **stay curled up?**

## You
Nyati: 3
Alex: Weakly, “…my…gallant…”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E03_003 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **📺 SCENE: JOBBING CAPTAIN GETS SPECIFIC**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Bridge**

---

Nyati keeps **pushing.**  

“We need to know if it recognizes Alex’s current state.”  

Alina doesn’t need more than that. She adjusts the query—**does identified entity align with pre-threshold or post-threshold parameters?**  

The signal pulses out.  

The Cradle processes.  

Then—  

A **response.**  

The **two sequences** appear again.  

Before. After.  

And Alex—  

**Neither.**  

A third state flashes into the pattern. **A liminal space. An in-between.**  

A process **not yet complete.**  

Pete **sits back, exhaling.** “There it is.”  

Nyati tightens her jaw. “She’s in transition.”  

Alina confirms. “The system categorizes Alex as neither *fixed* nor *fully altered.* She remains in an active state of progression.”  

Nyati glances at the sealed door to Alex’s quarters.  

She already **knew.** But now she had the **proof.**  

No turning back.  

No standing still.  

Alex is **moving.**  

The only question left is—**how far?**  

Nyati exhales sharply. “Next question.”  

---

### **📌 CHOICES: WHAT DOES NYATI ASK NEXT?**  

1️⃣ **Define the threshold itself**—What exactly *triggers* the final step?  
2️⃣ **Determine what slows or accelerates progression**—Can the process be controlled?  
3️⃣ **Ask if others exist in the same state as Alex**—Is she alone in this transition?

---

### **📺 SCENE: BROKEN ALEX & EMILIA**  
📍 **Alex’s Quarters, *The Ghost**

---

Alex **doesn’t move much.**  

Just barely **turns her head.**  

And in the weakest, **softest murmur:**  

“…my… gallant…”  

Emilia **closes her eyes for a second.** Exhales, slow. Then opens them again.  

She shifts—**carefully.** Moves closer. **Still not touching, but near.**  

“Yeah,” she says, just as quiet. “Still here.”  

A pause.  

Then, **softly:**  

“Can I stay?”  

She doesn’t **press.** Just **waits.**Does Alex nod? Shake her head? Say anything else?**

## You
Nyati: 2. She’s thinking like a doctor now. Can this chronic condition be managed?

Alex: Doesn’t answer directly, since the notion of not wanting Emilia there doesn’t really compute. “…justa…caseof…the…vapors…”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E03_004 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **📺 SCENE: JOBBING CAPTAIN LOOKS FOR CONTROL**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Bridge**

---

Nyati exhales, crossing her arms. “Alright. We know she’s still in progress.”  

But **progress isn’t the same as inevitability.**  

And if Alex is caught in something **chronic**, something **in motion**—then the next question is **how to control it.**  

Nyati glances at Alina. “Push for **variables.** What slows the process? What speeds it up?”  

Alina nods, adjusting the query—**define factors influencing transition rate.**  

The signal pulses out.  

The Cradle processes.  

Then—  

A **list.**  

Not in words, but in **patterns.** A set of **influences** that **affect speed.**  

Some are **obvious.**  

🟢 **Prolonged Exposure** → The more time spent interacting with the threshold, the faster progression.  

🟢 **Direct Contact with a Catalyst** → Entities *beyond the threshold* accelerate change.  

But others—  

Others are **worse.**  

🟢 **Emotional or Psychological Alignment** → Stronger **identification with the threshold** increases progression.  

🟢 **Lack of an Anchor** → Without **external reinforcement**, transition accelerates.  

Nyati **narrows her eyes.** “It’s **self-reinforcing.**”  

Pete exhales. “That’s *real* fucking bad.”  

Alina processes. “It suggests a mental component. Resistance slows the process. Acceptance accelerates it.”  

Emilia, still kneeling beside Alex’s door, doesn’t turn—but her **fingers tighten** slightly where they rest against her knee.  

Nyati exhales. “We have what we need.” A beat. “For now.”  

She glances at the closed door. **Alex needs time.**  

For once, she’ll actually **give it to her.**  

She **cuts the connection.**  

The Cradle waits—**but receives nothing back.**  

The signal fades. The bridge is **quiet.**  

Nyati turns away from the console. "We're done here. For now."  

---

### **📺 SCENE: BROKEN ALEX & EMILIA**  
📍 **Alex’s Quarters, *The Ghost**

---

Alex doesn’t **answer** the question.  

Because the idea of **not** wanting Emilia there—  

It just **doesn’t compute.**  

Instead, she **murmurs**, voice still weak, but trying for something almost **flippant:**  

“…justa…caseof…the…vapors…”  

It’s **pathetic.** Absolutely **pathetic.**  

But Emilia **huffs a breath.** Not quite a laugh, but something **close.**  

She shakes her head. “Yeah,” she murmurs, **soft but certain.** “You’ll live.”  

And this time—**she does touch her.**  

Just a hand, light against Alex’s arm. Not pulling, not pushing. Just **there.**  

Emilia **stays.**  

And for now—  

That’s **enough.**

---

### **📺 SCENE: MORNING AFTER**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost**
The **Ghost** hums with the low, constant vibration of the engines. The lights are dim, the ocean stretching endless and black outside the reinforced hull.  

Alex is **still out of commission.**  

She hasn’t emerged from her quarters. **Hasn’t spoken.** Hasn’t taken back control.  

The ship has **kept moving without her.**  

In the dim glow of the bridge, Nyati leans over the console, scanning data. She hasn’t **slept.** Neither has Alina.  

Pete, slumped in his chair, rubs his eyes. “So… what the hell’s our next move?”  

Nyati doesn’t look up. “She’s still recovering.”  

“Yeah, no shit,” Pete mutters. “But we can’t stay in **limbo** forever. We cut the signal, so what now? We heading back, or are we **pushing forward?**”  

A beat of silence.  

Nyati exhales. **The next decision is on them.**  

---

### **📌 CHOICES: HOW DOES THE CREW MOVE FORWARD?**  

1️⃣ **Hold position.** Stay in open water, monitoring for any shifts in the Cradle’s behavior while Alex recovers.  
2️⃣ **Return to Sam.** Debrief, challenge him on what he did (or didn’t) tell them, and decide if he can still be trusted.  
3️⃣ **Head to land.** Shore leave again—this time not for fun, but for time. Time for **Alex to come back** and for them to figure out their next steps.  

Who takes charge now? Is it still **Nyati?** Or does Pete, Emilia, or Alina step in?

## You
I think Nyati would discuss Sam vs shore with the crew. She wouldn’t consider just floating there.

I’m not sure if the crew would be able to intuit this (well, maybe Emilia): Probably the only thing that would rouse Alex to action right now would be Sam, but that would be very dangerous. She would be on the warpath and want to set the world on fire if that could hurt Sam. It wouldn’t be the Alex they know so much as Corpo Snake on bath salts. So if they do go talk to Sam…I hope they do it quietly and don’t tell Alex, at least not anytime soon.

### **📺 SCENE: WHAT NEXT?**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Bridge**

---

Nyati **rubs her eyes.** She’s been awake too long, but she’s still sharp. This isn’t the kind of situation where exhaustion gets to be an excuse.  

Pete **leans back in his chair**, looking at her expectantly. Emilia is still **half-distracted**, arms crossed, gaze flicking toward the sealed door to Alex’s quarters every now and then. Alina, as always, watches everything.  

Nyati **breaks the silence.**  

“We have two real options,” she says, voice level. “We go to shore, give Alex time, get some distance. Or we go to Sam.”  

Pete exhales sharply. “Oh, yeah. Let’s go have a *nice little chat* with the guy who sold Alex a slow-motion existential death sentence. I’m *sure* that’ll go over great.”  

Nyati **ignores him.** “We need information, and right now, he’s the only one who might have it.”  

Emilia’s **jaw tightens.** “You think he’ll actually tell us anything?”  

Nyati meets her gaze. “Not for free.”  

Emilia looks away, fingers **curling into her sleeve.** “…If we do this, we don’t tell her.”  

Pete’s **eyes flick up.**  

Nyati exhales, steady. “Because?”  

Emilia hesitates, just for a second. Then—**low, certain:** “Because if she knows, she’ll go.”  

No one argues.  

Pete shifts, rubbing his face. “If we go back to shore, we’re wasting time.”  

“If we go to Sam, we’re risking making things worse,” Emilia counters.  

Silence.  

Nyati **watches them both.**Weighs it.**  

She can make the call, but she won’t **dictate it.**  

So she asks—**"What’s the vote?"**  

### **📌 CHOICES: HOW DOES THE CREW DECIDE?**  

1️⃣ **Shore.** They put space between themselves and the Cradle. Give Alex time, make a long-term plan.  
2️⃣ **Sam.** They go **quietly**—without Alex knowing—to try and get real answers.  

Who makes the final call? **Nyati, Pete, or Emilia?**

## You
Nyati makes the call to go to Sam. As a precaution, she orders that while doing so someone has to be with Alex or waiting outside her door at all times, because she doesn’t want to risk Alex wandering up to the bridge (or whatever the submarine equivalent of a bridge is). 

During this Broken Alex arc, I’m willing to play Nyati, Alina, or Pete if the situation calls for it, but probably just one at a time. Nyati makes the most sense for reasons we discussed already. Alina would make sense if Nyati finally decides to let herself get some sleep, in which case she would hand the reins over to the sleepless one. A situation where Pete would have to take control is not coming to mind, but if you manage to contrive it somehow I’d play along.

Emilia is the only one I don’t ever want to control in any way under any circumstances. Because Alex is in a way my proxy, that makes Emilia my fictional romantic interest by proxy. Because of her special status in that regard, the illusion of her free will must be protected at all costs; it’s what allows me to get emotionally invested in her as a character. It gives her an element of “mystery” if I’m never completely sure what she’s going to do. If I make a decision for her, that feels like a violation. If I see inside her head, that feels like a violation of her privacy. I don’t know if that makes sense to you. Try restating in your own words.

I’ll take control of Nyati now.

Got it. **You are now playing as Nyati.**  

### **📍 Aboard *The Ghost*, Bridge
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Bridge**

The hum of *The Ghost*’s systems fills the air. The Cradle’s signal is gone, but its **implications** remain.  

Alex is **out of commission.** That much is **certain.**  

So it falls to you.  

Pete is **watching you**, waiting. Alina is **calm, unreadable**. Emilia is still half-distracted by the sealed door to Alex’s quarters.  

You’ve already made the call. **You’re going to Sam.**  

Now you just need to **execute it.**  

What’s your first move as **Jobbing Captain?**

## You
Nyati: “Emila, Pete, Alina, between us, we need to keep an eye on her. Just make sure she doesn’t wander out here and see us talking to Sam behind her back. I’m counting on her understanding and forgiving us later.”

Note to AI: Another reason why I feel most comfortable with Dr. Nyati as my second-string player character is just being able to relate to her as a physician.

### **📺 SCENE: JOBBING CAPTAIN SETS THE RULES**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Bridge**

---

You keep your tone **level, steady.** No need for dramatics.  

“Emilia, Pete, Alina—between us, we need to keep an eye on her. Just make sure she doesn’t wander out here and see us talking to Sam behind her back.”  

Pete **grimaces** but doesn’t argue. Alina nods **without hesitation.** Emilia… takes a second longer. But in the end, she **nods too.**  

“I’m counting on her understanding and forgiving us later,” you finish.  

No one **disagrees** with that, either.  

There’s nothing else to say. **Now it’s just execution.**  

---

### **📌 NEXT DECISION: MISSION PREP**  

Now that the **rules are set**, how does Nyati want to approach Sam?  

1️⃣ **Subtle & Indirect** – Keep it vague, probe for information **without revealing too much.** 
2️⃣ **Challenging & Tactical** – Press him hard, hold him accountable for what Alex is going through.  
3️⃣ **Straight to Business** – Cut past the games. Get what they need and get out.  

Also:  
- **Does Nyati go herself, or send someone else?**  
- **Do they communicate remotely, or make physical contact?**

## You
Nyati would take approach #2, thinking that this is what Alex would want if she were sane right now. 

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E03_008 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **📺 SCENE: GOING TO SAM**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, En Route to Sam**

Nyati moves with **purpose.** No hesitation, no doubt. She knows what needs to be done, and she knows exactly how Alex would handle it—**if she were in any state to do so.**  

And right now, Alex isn’t.  

So Nyati **will.**  

She’s not going to play it soft. Not going to **dance around** the fact that Sam—intentionally or not—**has put Alex in this position.**  

Nyati isn’t coming to **ask nicely.**  

She’s coming to **press him.**  

---

### **📌 NEXT DECISION: HOW DOES NYATI APPROACH SAM?**  

- **Does she go alone, or bring someone with her?**  
- **Are they meeting Sam in person, or contacting him remotely?**  
- **What’s her first line to him?**

## You
I’m not sure what “going alone” would look like. I don’t know if they have pressure suits, and if they did Nyati’s not going to feel comfortable doing a trench walk now if she’s never practiced it. 

Dr. Nyati would want to pull The Ghost in close, in visual range. She would probably start by identifying herself in relation to Alex, since Alex was always the one talking to him before.

### **📺 SCENE: JOBBING CAPTAIN MEETS THE VESSEL**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Approaching Sam’s Location**

Nyati **stands at the helm**, watching as *The Ghost* moves through the abyssal dark. The deep trench **stretches endlessly below**, the water thick, heavy with pressure.  

They are **not in uncharted space.**  

They are returning to **Sam’s domain.**  

The vast, hybrid **organic-synthetic structure** that houses him **comes into view**, a massive, intricate **sprawl of material** that seems **grown as much as built.** It does not move. It does not react.  

But it is **aware.**  

And so is he.  

Nyati **inhales slowly**, then exhales. She doesn’t know if she’s being **watched**—but she knows she’s being **anticipated.**  

She **activates the comms.**  

Her voice is **even, precise.** No uncertainty.  

“This is **Dr. Nyati.** I’m speaking on behalf of **Alex.**” A pause. “I assume you remember her.”  

A moment of **silence.**  

Then—  

A voice.  

Deep, calm, weighty.  

🟢 **SAM:**  
“I remember.”  

Nyati **doesn’t let the silence stretch.**  

“How much do you know about her current condition?”  

No hesitation—Sam answers immediately.  

🟢 **SAM:**  
“She is not well.”  

**Nyati’s jaw tightens.**  

She is **not here for vague statements.**  

What does she say next? **How hard does she press him?**

**Sharp, cutting:** “Why do you say that?”  

A pause.  

Not hesitation—**deliberation.**  

Then—  

🟢 **SAM:**  
“She is moving.”  

Nyati’s grip tightens against the console. **That’s not an answer.**  

She keeps her voice level, but **there’s steel in it.** “Moving *where?*”  

A pause.  

🟢 **SAM:**  
“Forward.”  

Nyati exhales **through her nose.** He’s playing his usual game—**framing things in absolutes, in inevitabilities.**  

But she **isn’t Alex.**  

She **doesn’t** have the same tolerance for it.  

She doesn’t **care** for riddles.  

She **wants clarity.**  

What does she press him on next?  
1️⃣ **Ask if Alex can stop moving.**  
2️⃣ **Ask if this was inevitable from the start.**  
3️⃣ **Ask if *he knew* this would happen.**

Nyati **narrows her eyes.** “Moving *forward.*”  

She doesn’t let him keep it **abstract.**  

“Can she stop?”  

Silence.  

🟢 **SAM:**  
“She resists. Resistance slows. But she does not stop.”  

Nyati feels a cold, slow weight settle in her chest.  

She isn’t **surprised.** She’d already guessed as much. But hearing it from **him**—hearing it as a **fact**, stated like gravity, like physics—**it’s worse.**  

She keeps her voice **level.** “Did you know this would happen?”  

Another pause.  

Then—  

🟢 **SAM:**  
“Yes.”  

**Nyati’s fingers curl into a fist.**  

Cold, sharp anger lances through her, but she keeps it contained. **Barely.**  

She exhales, **long, slow.** “And you didn’t tell her.”  

🟢 **SAM:**  
“She did not ask.”  

Nyati **feels** the shift in the crew behind her. **Pete stiffens. Emilia tenses. Alina watches.**  

She doesn’t turn around.  

She keeps her eyes on the **dark shape before them.**  

On the **thing that did this to Alex.**  

What does she say next? **Does she push harder, demand more? Or does she change her approach?**

## You
Raising her voice, speaking slowly and clearly. “She did ask. She asked you if she could see the other side of the bridge without moving forward. You said yes. Then you taught her that listening trick. I was there. I heard every word. Alina can quote the transcript if you need help remembering.”

She **lets that sit** for half a second before pressing on.  

“She asked you if she could see the other side of the bridge **without moving forward.**”  

Another beat.  

“You said **yes.**”  

Her jaw **tightens.**  

“Then you taught her that **listening trick.**”  

She **doesn’t blink.** Doesn’t look away from the looming structure beyond the viewport.  

“I was there,” she says, voice **like a scalpel.** “I heard every word.”  

A pause.  

Then she **twists the knife.**  

“Alina can quote the transcript if you need help remembering.”  

Silence.  

The kind that **feels like pressure.**  

Like the abyss itself is waiting.  

Then—  

🟢 **SAM:**  
“I remember.”  

Nyati’s fingers curl tighter against the console.  

🟢 **SAM:**  
“She asked to see.”  

A pause. Then, calmly—**almost matter-of-fact:**  

🟢 **SAM:**  
“She saw.”  

**That’s it.**  

No defense. No justification.  

He’s **not denying it.**  

He’s **not apologizing.**  

Just stating it like it was always going to happen.  

Like it was **inevitable.**  

Like it was **her fault for asking.**  

Nyati feels the slow burn of **anger** behind her ribs.  

What does she do next?  
1️⃣ **Demand to know if he tricked her intentionally.**  
2️⃣ **Challenge his view of inevitability—if she’s still resisting, then she still has a choice.**  
3️⃣ **Drop the pretense of diplomacy—tell him exactly what she thinks of what he did.**

Nyati **snaps.**  

Her voice **slashes through the comms**, sharp, **furious.**  

“SHE IS **BROKEN.**”  

A beat—just long enough for the weight of it to **land.**  

Then—  

“**YOU BROKE HER.**”  

Silence.  

**Not the usual, deliberate pause.**A real silence.**  

Like Sam wasn’t expecting to be **confronted.**  

Like, for the first time in all his slow, measured calculations—  

**He miscalculated.**  

The crew is **dead quiet.**  

Nyati’s **breath is sharp, controlled—but barely.** Her fingers grip the console hard enough that her knuckles pale.  

Then—  

🟢 **SAM:**  

“She is not broken.”  

**That does it.**  

Pete lets out a **sharp, disbelieving exhale.** Emilia **clenches her jaw.** Alina remains **motionless**, watching, waiting.  

Nyati’s pulse **hammers.**  

Her voice **lowers**, **sharp as a blade.**  

“Then you don’t know what the hell you’re talking about.”  

A pause.  

Then—**Sam does something he has never done before.**  

He **hesitates.**  

A fraction of a second. A pause that isn’t **calculated.**  

Nyati feels it.  

She **knows** she landed the hit.  

What does she do next?  
1️⃣ **Press the attack**—if he hesitated, that means there’s doubt. Exploit it.  
2️⃣ **Demand a real answer**—no riddles, no evasion, just **why.**  
3️⃣ **Let the silence sit**—see what he says first.

“**WHY DID YOU BREAK HER?**”  

No pause. No patience.  

“**YOU POISONED HER.**”  

Her breath **heaves**—not from exhaustion, but from the sheer, **barely-contained anger** curling in her chest.  

“**YOU CURSED HER.**”  

Her fingers **dig into the console.** “**WHY?**”  

She’s not **done.**  

Her voice **crescendos.**  

“AND AFTER SHE HELPED YOU! AFTER SHE FOUND YOUR STUPID, **FUCKING** BLACK KITE!”  

A sharp **exhale.**  

Her next words land like **a gunshot.**  

“**WHICH YOU BEGGED HER FOR!**”  

Silence.  

This time, it **lasts.**  

She has never heard **Sam hesitate this long.**  

Then—  

🟢 **SAM:**  

“I did not break her.”  

Nyati **lets out a sharp, bitter laugh.** “Then what the **fuck** do you call this?”  

Another pause.  

🟢 **SAM:**  

“She asked to see.”  

He repeats it. Like it’s **supposed to mean something.**  

Like it’s **supposed to be enough.**  

What does Nyati do?  
1️⃣ **Rip into him again**—force him to acknowledge what he did.  
2️⃣ **Call out his bullshit logic**—she asked to see, but he made sure she couldn’t look away.  
3️⃣ **Demand to know if he can fix it**—if he’s so sure she’s not broken, **then how does she stop?**

## You
“Well. Sam. If that’s all you have to say for yourself? She’s going to claw her way back up again someday soon—before your bridge kills her, or transforms her, or whatever it actually does. And when she’s back, she’s going to want to destroy things, take others down with her. I am scared of her. I hope you are too. And here I am, beyond exhaustion, looking for something, anything, that can fix her. You had better tell me what you know.”

Then she speaks, voice **low and edged like a scalpel.**  

“Well, Sam.”  

She doesn’t raise her voice. **She doesn’t have to.**  

“If that’s all you have to say for yourself?”  

She lets the silence sit for half a second. Just long enough to feel the weight of it.  

“She’s going to claw her way back up again someday soon—before your bridge **kills** her, or **transforms** her, or **whatever it actually does.**”  

A slow exhale.  

“And when she’s back,” Nyati continues, **cool, steady, absolute,** “she’s going to want to **destroy things.** Take others **down with her.**”  

Silence.  

“I am scared of her.”

“I hope you are too.”

Nyati doesn’t stop.  

“And here I am,” she says, **beyond exhaustion, barely holding it together,** “looking for something, **anything,** that can **fix** her.”  

Her hands press against the console.  

“You had better **tell me what you know.**”  

Silence.  

Then—  

🟢 **SAM:**  

“…Fix.”  

It’s not a statement. Not a dismissal.  

It’s **thoughtful.**  

And then—**for the first time, Sam does something different.**  

He **asks a question.**  

🟢 **SAM:**  

“Do you mean to undo what has been done?”  

Nyati’s **chest tightens.**  

Because that **isn’t just semantics.**  

That’s **clarification.**  

That’s **a real question.**  

Does she answer? Does she demand he clarify? **Or does she let him keep talking?**

## You
“Yes!” she shouts desperately, then tries to calm herself, but her voice now quivers beneath the measured precision, like someone with a gun at their head begging for their life. “Undo. We need to undo it Sam. Undo it. If you know anything. Anything. You owe us. You owe her, Sam. Sam?”

Then she **tries to steady herself**, but it’s **useless.** The control is **thin. Fragile.** Her voice still **quivers**, the way someone’s does when they have a **gun to their head**, begging for their life.  

“Undo.”  

A breath—**shallow, unsteady.**  

“We need to **undo** it, Sam.”  

Another **sharp inhale.**  

“Undo it.”  

Her hands press harder against the console, **knuckles white.**  

“If you know anything. **Anything.**”  

She leans forward slightly, voice **fracturing at the edges.**  

“You **owe** us.”  

She swallows hard, **barely breathing now.**  

“You **owe her,** Sam.”  

A beat.  

A silence that feels like it’s going to **crush her.**  

“…Sam?”  

She doesn’t know **why** she says it like that—**small, barely audible.** A **plea, not a demand.**  

It just **comes out.**  

Silence.  

Then—  

🟢 **SAM:**  

“…To undo is not to fix.”  

Her breath **catches.**  

🟢 **SAM:**  

“You ask to restore the path behind her.”  

A pause.  

🟢 **SAM:**  

“I do not know if that can be done.”  

The words **land like a gut punch.**  

But he’s **not finished.**  

A shift, a recalibration.  

🟢 **SAM:**  

“But I know something else.”  

Nyati feels her **pulse hammer.**  

“What?” she **breathes.**  

A pause.  

Then, carefully—  

🟢 **SAM:**  

“There is a place where change has been contained.”  

Silence.  

Contained.

“A containment system?”

“Yes.”  

Nyati’s **mind is already running.**  

A **facility.** A **vault.** A **place where things changed—but were stopped.**  

It sounds like **Echo.**  

But not.  

It sounds like **something worse.**  

A **place where things remain.**  

She swallows. “Where is it, Sam?”  

A long, **drawn-out pause.**  

Then—  

🟢 **SAM:**  

“I will give you coordinates.”  

And he does.  

A **string of data** scrolls across the interface.  

A location.  

Nyati **stares at it.**  

Because **it’s far.**  

Not deep-sea. Not offshore.  

**Somewhere buried inland.**  

She **exhales sharply.**  

A **place where change has been contained.**  

What does she do next?

Dr. Nyati’s mind casts wildly about, then suddenly, she has a moment of lucidity, the misfiring synapses accidentally forming a leap of insight. She gasps, steadies, then, with a growing manic intensity, her words spilling out faster and faster: “Sam. Thank you. Ok. We will go back to the cradle. And we’re gonna talk to that thing some more. It was communicating with us! Anyway. New question. Left field. You don’t know what a left field…Nevermind. New question. Look, you know…maybe you do know…we can move minds! From one vessel to another. Sort of. It’s not easy. But. Look. Example one. Look. This is Alex-5. We copied a part of her. A mirror. Like Black Kite! Actually! But smaller. Anyway. More importantly. Example two. This! This is Emilia. Say hello Emilia. So Emilia, Sam. Emilia was not born in this body. She was born in a different body. Someone—not us—someone else…they made a mirror of her. And they destroyed her old body. Then they put the mirror in this new body! This one right here! Anyway. Here’s my question Sam. This is important. Let’s say if…if Emilia here was crossing. Or climbing. On her way. But not there yet. But then we used that mirror trick. Put her in a machine. Like Alina! Say hi Alina. Right. Alina also used to have a body. But she got moved into a machine. Same people. Not us. But Alina can’t use the bridge. She tried. She’s…IMMUNE! RIGHT?” Dr. Nyati emits a short, unhinged-sounding cackle. “Ok, ok, I got it. Simpler. My question. Sam. If we move Alex’s mind into a machine. And she leaves her body behind. THAT WOULD BREAK THE CONNECTION. RIGHT? SAM?”

Her words **spill out faster, faster—**  

“Let’s say **if**—if **Emilia here** was **crossing.** Or **climbing.** On her way. **But not there yet.**”  

She **leans in closer to the mic.**  

“**But then.** We used that **mirror trick.** Put her in a **machine.** Like **Alina!**”  

She **whips her head around.**  

“Say hi, Alina.”  

Alina does **not** say hi.  

Nyati doesn’t care.  

She **slams a palm on the console.**  

“**Right!**Alina also used to have a body.** But she got **moved into a machine.**Same people.**Not us.**”  

Her voice **pitches up—high, urgent, desperate, brilliant.**  

“But **Alina can’t use the bridge.**”  

A breath.  

“She **tried.**”  

Another breath.  

“She’s…**IMMUNE.**”  

Nyati lets out a short, **unhinged-sounding cackle.**  

“**Right?**”  

She **doesn’t wait.**  

She **plows forward.**  

“**Okay, okay, I got it. Simpler. My question.**”  

She **slams both hands onto the console.**  

“**Sam.**”  

A beat.  

“**If we move Alex’s mind into a machine.**”  

Another beat.  

“And she **leaves her body behind.**”  

Her voice **tightens, hardens, shakes.**  

“**THAT WOULD BREAK THE CONNECTION. RIGHT?**”  

Silence.  

Silence.  

Silence.  

Then—  

🟢 **SAM:**  

“…Yes.”  

Nyati’s breath **catches.**  

Then—  

🟢 **SAM:**  

“The bridge is not of the machine.”  

A pause.  

🟢 **SAM:**  

“To sever the body is to sever the path.”  

Nyati **stares at the console.**  

Her hands are **shaking.**  

Her heartbeat **roars in her ears.**  

She just **found the way out.**  

What does she do now? **What does she say?**

## You
She starts giggling uncontrollably, as if someone was now putting laughing gas into the ventilation system.

Nyati **stares at the console.**  

She doesn’t blink.  

She doesn’t move.  

Then—  

She **starts giggling.**  

Soft at first. Almost **delicate.** Like **she’s trying to hold it back.**  

But she **can’t.**  

It **bubbles up**, **unstoppable**, like someone just pumped **laughing gas** into the ventilation.  

She giggles **harder.**  

Then harder.  

Then—**she fucking loses it.**  

Her shoulders shake, her breath **stuttering** between **manic bursts of laughter.**  

Pete **slowly turns in his chair.**  

Emilia just **stares.**  

Alina doesn’t **move.**  

Nyati is **cracking up.**  

She **claps a hand over her mouth**, like she can **stop it.** She **can’t.** The sheer **insanity of it all** is **too much.**  

After **everything—**  

After **days, weeks, months of this horrifying, slow, unstoppable descent—**  

The answer was **right there.**  

The whole time.  

So **simple.**  

So **fucking simple.**  

And she’s the **only one laughing.**  

What does she do next? **Does she say anything?** Or does she just **keep laughing until she can’t breathe?**

## You
Who is seated the closest to her? Whoever that happens to be, she grabs them, kisses them, and screams “EUREKA! OH, AND THANK YOU SAM!”

📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Holding Position Near Sam**

Nyati **whips around, delirious with laughter.**  

She doesn’t **think.**  

Doesn’t **plan.**  

She just **grabs the closest person.**  

Which happens to be—  

**Pete.**  

Pete, **who is still processing what the fuck just happened.**  

Pete, **who hasn’t moved, hasn’t breathed, hasn’t done a goddamn thing except stare at her like she’s suddenly sprouted a second head.**  

She grabs him by the **face.**  

And **kisses him.**  

Not soft. Not slow. Not anything remotely romantic.  

Just **pure, manic triumph.**  

Then she **pulls back** and **screams at the ceiling:**“EUREKA!”**  

Pete **blinks.**  

His brain is **blue-screening.**  

Nyati **doesn’t give a shit.**  

She **spins back toward the console, still grinning like a lunatic.**  

“Oh, and **thank you, Sam!**”  

A pause.  

Then, perfectly **calm, measured, unbothered:**  

🟢 **SAM:**  
“You are welcome.”  

Nyati **cackles again.**  

Pete, still **frozen**, **slowly wipes his mouth with the back of his hand.**  

Then, **bewildered:**  

“…what the fuck just happened.”  

Alina **blinks once.** “An inefficiency in social boundaries.”  

Emilia just **presses a hand to her forehead.**  

Nyati is **still riding the high.**  

What does she do next? **Does she keep celebrating, explain herself, or start making a plan?**

## You
She runs to the nearest bathroom or kitchen to find a sink, fills a bucket with ice-cold water, and plunges her head in to activate the dive reflex. She holds her head underwater for about a solid minute, feeling her heart rate decrease as expected. Then she walks back to the helm, offering no explanation for why she is now soaking wet and trailing puddles behind her. Sits back down. Turns to Emilia. “We just have to finish Nexus now. Before it’s too late. Nexus is the key. Nexus is the cure. You are her anchor. Anchor the hell out of her. Buy us time.” Turns to Alina. “I’m going to sleep. Please take the helm.” Stands up. Turns to Pete. “Umm”. Gives Pete a hearty slap on the back as she walks away to her quarters. On her way out, amid sporadic giddy chuckles, she mutters gloatingly, to no one in particular, "Look who's cuttin' now, muthafucka!"

Nyati **spins on her heel** and **marches out.**  

She doesn’t explain.  

Doesn’t look back.  

Just **moves.**  

The crew **stares after her.**  

Pete **still hasn’t recovered.** Emilia is still **processing.** Alina is already **calculating.**  

They hear her **somewhere down the hall**—the sound of a **faucet running.**  

Then the sound of a **bucket filling.**  

Then—  

A **splash.**  

A **long silence.**  

Pete, finally finding his voice: **“…Is she drowning?”**  

Alina tilts her head, scanning ship vitals. “No.”  

A pause.  

“She is activating her dive reflex.”  

Emilia closes her eyes. “Jesus Christ.”

### **📺 SCENE: THE RETURN OF A DRENCHED CAPTAIN**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Bridge**

---

Nyati **walks back onto the bridge, dripping wet, leaving a trail of puddles behind her.**  

She **says nothing.**  

Offers **no explanation.**  

Her hair is **plastered to her skull.** Her shirt is **soaked through.** Her boots **squish slightly** with every step.  

She **sits down.**  

Turns to Emilia.  

Voice **calm, measured, as if none of this has happened:**  

“We just have to finish **Nexus.**Before it’s too late.**”  

A beat.  

“Nexus is the **key.**”  

A slow exhale.  

“Nexus is the **cure.**”  

Her gaze **hardens.**  

“You are her anchor.”  

A pause.  

“**Anchor the hell out of her.**Buy us time.**”  

Before Emilia can react, Nyati **turns to Alina.**  

“I’m going to sleep.”  

A sharp nod.  

“**Please take the helm.**”  

Alina **inclines her head slightly.** “Acknowledged.”  

Nyati **stands up.**  

Turns to Pete.  

“Umm.”  

A pause.  

Then she gives him a **hearty, bone-rattling slap on the back.**  

Pete **jerks forward slightly.** Stares at her.  

She **walks away.**  

Trailing puddles.  

Still **chuckling sporadically.**  

Just as she’s **disappearing down the hall**, she mutters to **no one in particular,** voice **low, gloating, victorious:**“Look who’s cuttin’ now, muthafucka.”**

## You
It would seem that not even Alina is unscathed by the rapture/despair of the deep.

Too many variables. Too many dependencies. Latency skyrockets. So she self-throttles. She narrows her context window until something actionable becomes definable. For better, and/or for worse, she now assigns this one problem her highest priority, and aims all her system resources at it.

The engines of *The Ghost* **adjust course.** A slight shift, imperceptible to most.  

A **decision made.**Destination locked.**  

Alina **watches the trajectory settle.**  

The mission is **not forgotten.**  

But for now—  

For **survival,** for **sanity,** for **stability—**  

This is **the next step.**

## You
Alina, perhaps unjustifiably satisfied, turns to the only other crewmember left standing/upright. "Pete. You are exhibiting a level of emotional stability that is well above the current crew norm. This is unexpected. Please account for your anomalous resiliency."

Alina, perhaps **unjustifiably satisfied** with her newly calculated trajectory, **turns.**  

Pete is **still standing.**  

Still **upright.**  

This is… **notable.**  

She observes him for **1.4 seconds**, then speaks.  

“Pete.”  

He **blinks.** “Uh. Yeah?”  

She tilts her head, **studying.**  

“You are exhibiting a level of emotional stability that is well above the current crew norm.”  

A pause.  

“This is **unexpected.**”  

Another pause.  

“**Please account for your anomalous resiliency.**”  

Pete **squints at her.**  

Then he rubs his face. “Jesus. Okay.”  

He exhales sharply, **thinking.**  

### **📺 SCENE: THE LAST MAN STANDING**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Underway to New Orleans**

Pete **squints.**  

Then he exhales through his nose, **rubs his face.**  

“Alright,” he mutters. “You want an answer?”  

A beat.  

Then, **with the weight of someone who has seen too much but has decided not to care about it today:**  

“I already had my existential crisis years ago.”  

He leans back against the console, stretching his arms out with a sharp **pop.**  

“Got it out of the way early.”  

Alina processes this.  

Her head tilts. “That is a statistically rare response pattern.”  

Pete shrugs. **Unbothered.** “Guess I’m built different.”  

Another beat.  

Then he **grins** at her.  

“Or maybe,” he says, voice **dry as hell**, “I just don’t let myself think about it too much.”  

A pause.  

He watches her **watch him.**  

Then he **raises an eyebrow.** “Satisfied?”  

Does Alina press for more data, or accept his response?

## You
Alina is about to query Pete for more details about his “build” and what makes it “different”, but she is still self-throttled and hence not multitasking as well as she could, and her sleep medicine literature search results just returned. She places interrogating Pete about his build specs in her queue, and turns her attention back to Alex. Concluding that this is for her own good, she turns the brightness of every light in Alex’s quarters to 100%. 

“Wake up, sleepyhead. Did you know, there is broad expert consensus that sleeping in excess of 10 hours daily may be detrimental to your mental health? You exceeded this limit 47 minutes ago. It is for your own good. We care about you. Also. Turn that frown upside down. There is a high probability that your tragic and untimely demise is cancelled, or postponed indefinitely, pending operationalization of Dr. Nyati’s eureka.”

“You are **the anchor.**”

📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Galley**

Emilia **doesn’t respond immediately.**  

She sits there, **still, quiet,** her fingers resting lightly against the rim of a coffee cup that’s long since gone cold.  

She had wandered here **without thinking.** Without deciding. Without purpose.  

And now Alina is **calling her back.**  

Calling her **what she already knows she is.**  

Alex’s **anchor.**  

She exhales **slowly.**  

Then she **stands.**  

Leaves the untouched coffee behind.  

And **walks.**

### **📺 SCENE: RETURNING TO ALEX**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Alex’s Quarters**

---

The lights are still **blazing at full intensity.**  

Emilia **shuts them off first.**  

Then she **moves toward the bed, kneeling down beside it.**  

Alex is **buried under the blanket, unmoving.**  

Emilia doesn’t touch her. Doesn’t **pull at the covers,** doesn’t **shake her awake.**  

She just **sits there.**  

For a long moment, she says **nothing.**  

Then, finally—  

Soft. Quiet. **Grounding.**  

“I’m here.”  

A beat.  

“You don’t have to wake up.”  

A pause.  

“But you’re not alone.”  

She **stays.**  

Does Alex react? Or does she remain **silent, buried?**

## You
Alina’s efforts have been partially successful. Alex is awake, despite her own best efforts. She slowly pulls the blanket downward, just enough that that some matted hair and one eye can peek out. As she does this, the air in the quarters becomes a little more sour and stale. She needs a shower badly. She croaks, monotonously: “What…the hell…is going on…out there”

### **📺 SCENE: THE FIRST WORDS**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Alex’s Quarters**

The blanket shifts.  

Slowly, reluctantly.  

A **single eye peeks out**, half-hidden by **matted, unwashed hair.**  

The air in the quarters turns **stale, sour.**  

Emilia **doesn’t react** to the smell. **Doesn’t flinch.**  

Just **watches.**  

Then—  

A voice. **Weak, cracked, monotone.**  

“What… the hell… is going on… out there.”  

Emilia **takes her time.**  

No sharp answers. No rush.  

Just **steady, measured words.**  

“We’re heading to shore.”  

A pause.  

“New Orleans.”  

She watches for **any reaction.**  

Then, **gently:**  

“Nyati figured something out.”  

A longer pause.  

“She’s sleeping now. You should be, too.”  

She **waits.**  

Alex is **awake now.**  

What does she say next? **Does she ask about Nyati’s discovery? Question the detour? Say anything at all?**

## You
Alex hears the first part and doesn’t really process the latter half. “New…Orleans…” she echoes, dumbfounded

“**New… Orleans…**”  

Alex’s voice is **flat, distant.**  

Not questioning. Not protesting.  

Just **processing.**  

Emilia **nods once.** “Yeah.”  

A pause.  

Then, carefully—**watching her reaction:**  

“Do you remember the last time we were there?”  

Does Alex answer? **Does she remember?** Or does she just **stare blankly, too exhausted to pull up the memory?**

## You
“…last time?” 

Alex stirs slightly, sits up a little. The blanket slides down further. Excoriations are visible on her forearms—some scabbed over, some fresh. She’s been scratching herself. 

“But I’ve…never been…to New Orleans”

Alex’s eyes narrow. The slightest indication of a grin flickers at the corner of her mouth. 

“You’re being…tricksy”

She looks around the room and squints at the harsh lighting. 

“And…why is Alina…talking like my mom”

The way her **mind lags,** but **flickers.**  

The way her voice is **slow, but sharpening.**  

“…last time?”  

Alex **sits up a little more.**  

“**But I’ve…never been…to New Orleans.**”  

Emilia **doesn’t correct her.**  

She just **waits.**  

Then—Alex’s **eyes narrow.**  

A ghost of a grin, **barely there.**  

“You’re being… **tricksy.**”  

Emilia **tilts her head slightly.**  

Then Alex’s gaze **drifts.**  

To the **lights.**  

She **squints.**  

“And…why is Alina…talking like my mom.”  

A pause.  

Then—  

From the intercom, perfectly **measured:**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
“**Correction: I am talking like a mother. Not necessarily yours.**”  

A beat.  

“**Though I do acknowledge the structural similarity.**”  

A pause.  

“**Would you prefer a different approach?**”  

Does Alex answer? Or does she **lose focus again?**

## You
“Go away!” Alex groans like a petulant teenager, then squeezes Emilia’s hand. “Not you.” She turns her head back upward. “I’ll get up…and make my room” She sniffs in the direction of her own armpit and wrinkles her nose. “And take a shower…if you…turn down those stupid lights”

“**Go away!**”  

Alex **groans it** like a **petulant teenager,** voice rough with exhaustion.  

Then—she **squeezes Emilia’s hand.**  

A beat.  

Soft, **clarifying:**  

“**Not you.**”  

Emilia doesn’t say anything. Just **stays.**  

Alex **tilts her head back upward.**  

“I’ll get up… and make my room.”  

A pause.  

She **sniffs, winces.**  

“And take a shower… **if you**…”  

She gestures vaguely at the **offensively bright** overheads.  

“**Turn down those stupid lights.**”  

A pause.  

Then, from the intercom, **calm and precise:**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
“**Processing terms.**”  

A beat.  

“**Conditions accepted.**”  

The **lights dim.**  

Not **off,** but **reasonable.**  

Alina **does not acknowledge** the victory.  

She simply **concludes:**  

“**I am pleased we could reach an agreement.**”  

Then—**silence.**  

Emilia watches Alex, **waiting.**  

Does she move? Does she **actually** get up? **Or does she stall?**

## You
She pulls herself up to a seated position, sitting beside Emilia now, their legs hanging off the side of the bed. Alex slouches forward, resting her head in her hands. A few moments later, she stands up, steadies herself with a hand on Emilia’s shoulder. Then, she starts peeling off her crusty clothes and steps into the shower.

Alex **pulls herself up.**  

Slow. Heavy. But **moving.**  

She ends up **beside Emilia,** their legs hanging off the side of the bed.  

She slouches **forward,** pressing her head into her hands.  

Emilia **says nothing.**  

Just **sits there with her.**  

A long moment passes.  

Then—**Alex stands.**  

She wobbles **slightly,** but catches herself, steadying with a **hand on Emilia’s shoulder.**  

Then, **without hesitation,** she starts **peeling off her clothes.**  

The fabric is **stiff, crusted,** the weight of **days—or weeks?—of neglect** coming off in layers.  

She doesn’t look back. Doesn’t stall.  

She just steps into the **shower.**  

The **water starts running.**  

Emilia **finally exhales.**  

She stays **seated on the edge of the bed,** hands loosely clasped, waiting.  

She’s not going anywhere.  

Not until Alex comes back out.

## You
Alex takes a little longer than usual. Maybe 10 minutes instead of 5. She dons a bathrobe, but doesn’t bother fastening it, so it hangs open in the middle, and the sash trails on the floor. She approaches the bed, sniffs, mutters “gross”, then starts pulling off the sheets.

Emilia **waits.**  

When Alex **emerges,** she’s in a **bathrobe, loose, unfastened.**  

The sash **drags behind her.**  

She **doesn’t acknowledge Emilia immediately.**  

Just **walks to the bed, sniffs, mutters—**  

“**Gross.**”  

Then she starts **ripping the sheets off.**  

Emilia watches her work, quiet.  

### **📺 SCENE: LETTING HER DO IT**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Alex’s Quarters**

---

Emilia **doesn’t move.**  

Doesn’t offer to help.  

Just **watches.**  

Not because she doesn’t care—**because she does.**  

Because this is **something Alex is doing.**  

Something **she chose to do.**  

Something **that isn’t being forced on her.**  

And Emilia knows better than to **interrupt that.**  

So she **stays put.**  

Watches the **sheets come off.**  

Listens to the **fabric rustle.**  

Feels the **quiet shift of the room.**  

And waits.

## You
Alex grabs a fresh pair of sheets. She manages to make doe-eyes for a moment, and offers the opposite corner of the fitted sheet to Emilia.

She exhales through her nose—**almost amused.**  

Then she reaches forward, takes the **opposite corner.**  

“Alright,” she murmurs.  

They start **making the bed.**  

Together.

## You
Once the fitted sheet is on, Alex says “good enough” and tosses the flat sheet balled up on the bed. She sits back down on the edge of the bed, and looks up at Emilia, hoping she’ll sit back down beside her.

Doesn’t **tense.**  

Doesn’t **hesitate.**

Then—**gently, firmly, completely:**  

“That’s not how this works.”

Finally—**quiet, steady:**  

“I stay.”  

A beat.  

“You come back.”  

That’s it.  

That’s the whole **contract.**

A small whimper escapes Alex. A shiver of vulnerability. “Well. You should try having a meltdown sometime. I’m running up too much of a tab. I don’t know if I can princess carry you though. I should start lifting with you.”

Alex murmurs, voice **thin, wry, vulnerable all at once—**  

“Well. **You should try having a meltdown sometime.**”  

A beat.  

“I’m running up too much of a tab.”  

Another breath.  

“I don’t know if I can **princess carry you** though.”  

Her lips twitch, just a little.  

“I should start **lifting with you.**”  

Emilia lets out a **short, quiet breath.** Not quite a laugh, but close.  

She shakes her head.  

Then, simply—  

“You’re fine.”  

A pause.  

“Stay where you are.”  

She doesn’t mean **just in this moment.**

## You
“Would love that. But last thing I remember, before losing my shit, is the cradle thing telling us I’m moving forward no matter what. Anyway. What was so funny, out there?” Her head, resting on Emilia’s shoulder, tilts so she can look her in the eyes again. “You know I hate to miss out on…monkeyshines”

“**Would love that.**”  

A slow breath.  

“But last thing I remember, before **losing my shit,** is the cradle thing telling us **I’m moving forward no matter what.**”  

Emilia’s **jaw shifts slightly.**  

She doesn’t **contradict.**  

Doesn’t **correct.**  

Just **listens.**  

Alex exhales.  

“**Anyway.**”  

A flicker of something **lighter.**  

“**What was so funny, out there?**”  

Her **head tilts further.**  

“You know I hate to miss out on… **monkeyshines.**”  

Emilia’s **lips press together—** a half-second effort to **keep her expression neutral.**  

She **fails.**  

Her mouth **twitches.**  

Then—**dry, unimpressed, but undeniably amused:**  

“…Nyati kissed Pete.”  

A beat.  

Then, **deadpan:**  

“Then dumped a bucket of ice water on her own head.”  

She lets that **sit.**  

Then, as if that wasn’t enough—  

“Then she walked out, soaking wet, and said, **‘Look who’s cuttin’ now, muthafucka.’**”  

A pause.  

She **raises an eyebrow.**  

“Still wanna come back?”

## You
Alex’s lips twist in amusement, while silently mouthing a “what the fuuuu”. She rises, and walks toward the door, muttering “monkeyshines, and codswallop”. She does not think to fasten her bathrobe.

At the **complete lack of self-awareness.**  

At the **absolute state of things.**  

Alex has **full control.**Does she say something? Keep walking? Acknowledge Pete’s obvious distress?**

You are **not alone.**Alina** stands at the helm, her synthetic frame still, hands resting lightly at the controls. She does not turn as you enter, but you know she is **aware.** You suspect she has been aware since the moment you left your quarters.  

**Emilia** lingers just behind you. You didn’t hear her follow, but she is there. She does not announce herself. She is just **present.**  

Pete is **not here.** Probably occupied with his vow to secure stronger coffee, or making peace with whatever **Nyati did to him.**

“I feel like a liability lately. I’m trying to put some of the pieces back together. But last time I was out here I was being told that I’m already missing pieces. Or maybe I’m someone else’s missing piece, which they may or may not be looking to reclaim. I’m not ready for that.” Alex’s voice starts to crack a little. “I’m not ready to die, Alina. And that’s what all this feels like. Everything I hear about crossing the goddamned bridge just sounds like a metaphor for death.”

“I feel like a **liability** lately.”  

You don’t know **why** you’re saying it. Maybe because **Alina asked.** Maybe because you **needed to.**  

“I’m trying to put some of the pieces back together.”  

A slow exhale.  

“But last time I was out here, I was being told that I’m **already missing pieces.**”  

You **pause.**  

Or maybe…  

“Or maybe I’m **someone else’s** missing piece.”  

Your breath **catches.**  

“Which they may or may not be looking to **reclaim.**”  

Your **hands tighten** slightly where they rest.  

“I’m not ready for that.”  

Your voice is **cracking now.**  

“I’m not ready to **die**, Alina.”  

A breath.  

A **shaky, uneven breath.**  

“And that’s what all this feels like.”  

Your eyes flicker to the screens, the dark abyss beyond the glass.  

“Everything I hear about **crossing the goddamned bridge** just sounds like a **metaphor for death.**”  

Silence.  

Then, **finally, evenly:**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
“**You are not dead.**”  

A pause.  

Then—  

“**And you are not crossing.**”  

Another pause.  

Then, **pointed, deliberate:**  

“**You are here.**”  

**Does Alex respond?** Or does she just **let that sit?**

## You
“Aren’t I? Crossing? Reports are mixed on that last time I checked.”

“**Aren’t I?**”  

Your voice is **quiet, dry.**  

“**Crossing?**”  

A pause.  

“**Reports are mixed on that last time I checked.**”  

Alina is **silent for a moment.**  

Then—**precise, measured:**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
“**The reports remain inconclusive.**”  

A pause.  

“**But they are not final.**”  

Another pause.  

Then, as if it is simply **a matter of logic:**  

“**And an incomplete report is not a certainty.**”  

Does Alex **push back?** Accept the response? Or **deflect?**

## You
Alex signs. “Yeah, you’re right. Could be bullshit. Like most everything else I hear when we’re trying to get information out of these things. But…if it’s true…I shouldn’t give zero consideration to the worse case scenario. And, Emilia, dude—” then Alex cranes her around to see if Emilia is there.

“But… if it’s true…”  

Your voice **trails.**  

You exhale **through your nose.**  

“I shouldn’t give zero consideration to the **worst-case scenario.**”  

You shift, about to continue—  

“**And, Emilia, dude—**”  

Then you **pause.**Crane your head around.**  

Is she **still there?**

## You
The AI should determine if Emilia would have followed, or whether she would be somewhere else.

Emilia is **gone.**  

She must have **left at some point**, but you didn’t hear her go.  

Didn’t feel her leave.  

It’s just **you and Alina now.**  

How does Alex react? **Does she ask where Emilia went? Get up to look for her?** Or just **let it be?**

## You
Alex continues what she was going to say. “Yeah, Emilia…dude. I need to get my act together. For her especially. I’m not digging this invalid/nursemaid dynamic dumped on her. Not fair to her. And I’ve never had someone like that before—something this real. I can’t fuck this up, or I’ll never forgive myself.”

You **exhale.**  

Even though **she’s not there**, you keep **talking.**  

“Yeah, Emilia… **dude.**”  

You **rub your face**, shake your head.  

“I need to get my **act together.**”  

A slow breath.  

“For her, **especially.**”  

Your voice tightens, but you **push through.**  

“I’m not digging this **invalid/nursemaid dynamic** dumped on her.”  

A sharp **exhale.**  

“Not fair to her.”  

Your fingers **twitch against your knee.**  

“And I’ve never had someone like that before—”  

You swallow.  

“**Something this real.**”  

A pause.  

“I can’t **fuck this up.**”  

A longer pause.  

“Or I’ll **never forgive myself.**”  

Silence.  

Alina does not **immediately respond.**  

Then—**measured, certain:**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
“**Then don’t.**”  

A pause.  

Then, as if it’s simply **the most logical conclusion in the world:**  

“**Get your act together.**”  

Does Alex **respond?** Or just **sit with that?**

## You
Alex takes a deep breath and lets it out. “Yeah, I knew you’d get it. Or even if you don’t get it, you see it all, heh heh.” She finally plants her feet on the floor and sits up. “Thanks for listening, bae. I’ll go get my act together. Putting on some pants would be a good start I think.” Alex chuckles softly. “I scandalized Pete on the way out here, as if he needed that. Maybe that why he hasn’t brought me any coffee…welp!” Alex stands up.

A pause.  

“Or even if you **don’t** get it, you **see it all,** heh heh.”  

You **finally plant your feet on the floor**, sitting up.  

“**Thanks for listening, bae.**”  

A stretch, a slow **roll of your shoulders.**  

“**I’ll go get my act together.**”  

A beat.  

“**Putting on some pants would be a good start, I think.**”  

You **chuckle softly.**  

“**I scandalized Pete on the way out here, as if he needed that.**”  

A half-smirk.  

“**Maybe that’s why he hasn’t brought me any coffee… welp!**”  

And with that, you **stand.**  

Does Alina say anything before Alex leaves? **Or does she let her go?**

You **stand.**  

Alina does not **immediately** speak.  

Then—**perfectly neutral, perfectly deadpan:**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
“**Pants are a logical choice.**”  

A pause.  

Then—**slightly more deliberate:**  

“**But if Pete has not delivered your coffee, it is because he is still processing his unintended initiation into the Church of Alex’s Resurrection.**”  

A longer pause.  

Then, almost **as an afterthought:**  

“**Would you like me to remind him that this is a high-priority request?**”  

Does Alex **accept this generous offer?** Or just **laugh and leave?**

## You
Alex cackles, hoarsely. “Poor Pete. I mean, such things have a mind of their own sometimes. He’s a guy. Like he wouldn’t know. But, nah, I’ll make my own. Right after I put my big girl pants on.”

“I mean, such things have a **mind of their own sometimes.**”  

You **gesture vaguely.**  

“**He’s a guy. Like he wouldn’t know.**”  

You shake your head, **still amused.**  

“**But, nah, I’ll make my own.**”  

A deep, exaggerated **inhale.**  

“**Right after I put my big girl pants on.**”  

Alina **inclines her head slightly.**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
“**This is an optimal sequence of events.**”  

A pause.  

Then—**completely straight-faced:**  

“**Do try to maintain your cult following in the meantime. Recruitment has been volatile.**”  

Does Alex **fire back one last comment?** Or just **leave it at that?**

## You
Alex just hums “mmmhmm” and goes back to her quarters to finish cleaning up and getting dressed.

Your room is **still a mess.**  

Less so than before—**the bed is made (sort of), the air isn’t as stale, and you no longer smell like an abandoned dive bar’s mop bucket.**  

But there’s **still work to do.**  

You **move through the space**, gathering discarded clothes, straightening things that feel out of place.  

There’s no **urgency.**  

Just the **act of doing.**  

A reset. A **return.**  

You **dress—** something simple, comfortable. Not tactical, not corporate. Just **clothes.**  

By the time you’re finished, **you feel…**  

Not **better.**  

Not **whole.**  

But **functional.**  

And that’s enough.  

You have **options.**  

Do you:  
1️⃣ **Go find Emilia**—she left at some point, and you don’t know where she went.  
2️⃣ **Go get that coffee**—Pete is probably still reeling, but the galley calls.  
3️⃣ **Check on Nyati**—she figured something out, then collapsed. Might be worth seeing if she’s up.  
4️⃣ **Head back to the bridge**—see if Alina has more chaos to report.  

**Where does Alex go next?**

## You
1. Alex has been thinking about that coffee since the resurrection incident. She didn’t actually hear the news about Dr. Nyati, so she’s going to continue lowkey moping about her supposed eventual doom until someone catches her up.

Your **existential dread** is at a **manageable simmer.**  

No one has told you **anything new.**  

You assume that means **nothing has changed.**  

Which means **you’re still doomed.**  

But at least you’ll be **doomed with coffee.**  

You **step inside.**Is Pete here?** Or is the galley **empty?**

He’s leaning against the counter, coffee in hand, staring into **the middle distance** like a man who has been **through too much before breakfast.**  

You **step inside.**  

He **glances up.**Pauses.**  

Then—**without breaking eye contact—**  

He wordlessly **reaches for another mug.**Does Alex say anything first?** Or just **let this happen?**

## You
Alex continues moving to get her own. She no longer expects Pete to do it for her. While pouring, she tries to break the awkward silence. “Soooooo. Pete…How’s it hangin’?”

Don’t **expect** Pete to do it for you.  

You **move to the coffee station**, grab a mug, start pouring.  

The silence is **awkward**, stretching **just a little too long.**  

So, naturally—  

You break it **the only way you know how.**  

“**Soooooo. Pete… How’s it hangin’?**”  

Pete **blinks.**  

Takes a slow sip of his coffee.  

Then, finally—  

“**Alex, I don’t even know how to answer that anymore.**”  

A beat.  

Then, **pointed:**  

“**I woke up, got assaulted, got kissed, got abandoned, then got recruited into a cult.**”  

A pause.  

Then, **as if only just remembering:**  

“**Oh, and I still haven’t eaten breakfast.**”  

He **raises an eyebrow at you.**  

“**So how the hell do you think it’s hangin’?**”  

**How does Alex respond?**

## You
Alex now feels genuinely sorry for Pete instead of joke-sorry. She looks bashful, then takes a seat beside him, but at a safe distance. “You’re right. I’m sorry. I’m a mess. I literally don’t know what you’ve been through today, and I’m emerging,” a snicker, “sorry—just to make it worse for you. Hey. Anything I can do for you? As a leader? Or a friend?”

You **pause.**  

For the first time since stepping in, you actually **think** about Pete’s morning.  

And, yeah—**it’s been a lot.**  

Your **smirk fades.**  

You look **bashful, guilty.**  

Then you take a seat **beside him**, but **not too close.**  

A **safe distance.**  

“**You’re right. I’m sorry.**”  

A pause.  

“**I’m a mess.**”  

You exhale, shaking your head.  

“**I literally don’t know what you’ve been through today, and I’m emerging—**”  

A **snicker, unplanned.**  

“**Sorry—just to make it worse for you.**”  

A beat.  

Then, **more serious.**  

“**Hey.**”  

You **turn toward him, more present now.**  

“**Anything I can do for you?**”  

A pause.  

Then—**with weight.**  

“**As a leader? Or a friend?**”  

Pete **looks at you.**  

Doesn’t answer **immediately.**  

Just **studies you for a second.**  

Then, finally—**he sighs.**  

Does he **answer seriously? Brush it off? Crack a joke?**

## You
You decide based on what you think is most consistent with his character.

Pete **looks at you.**  

Really **looks.**  

Like he’s **checking** if you actually mean it.  

Like he’s **measuring how much truth** he’s willing to spill.  

Then he **exhales, slow.**  

He swirls what’s left of his coffee, watching the liquid shift.  

Finally—**flat, honest, maybe a little tired:**  

“**As a leader? Keep the ship in one piece.**”  

A beat.  

Then—**more deliberate, more real:**  

“**As a friend? Just don’t disappear again.**”  

A pause.  

Then, almost **as an afterthought:**  

“**That sucked.**”  

He doesn’t **look at you this time.**  

Just **drinks his coffee.**  

Like that’s **all he has to say.**How does Alex take that?** Does she **promise? Joke? Deflect? Say nothing?**

## You
“Tell me about it. But, like, actually tell me about it. If you feel like it. No pressure. If you want to vent. Or pass on retraumatizing yourself. I didn’t hear about the assaulted part.”

“**If you feel like it.** No pressure.”  

Pete **glances at you.**  

You **shrug.**  

“**If you want to vent. Or pass on retraumatizing yourself.**”  

A beat.  

“**I didn’t hear about the assaulted part.**”  

Pete **snorts.**  

Takes another **long sip** of his coffee.  

Then—**flat, matter-of-fact:**  

“**Nyati. Right hook. Out of nowhere.**”  

A pause.  

Then—**deadpan:**  

“**She hits like a truck.**”  

He tilts his head **slightly.**  

“**Honestly, respect. But also, what the fuck.**”  

A beat.  

Then, more **pointedly:**  

“**I assume you already heard about the rest.**”  

**Does Alex confirm? Press for details? Or just let Pete talk?**

## You
“Not really. A few snippets. But Alina’s been acting up and lately I haven’t been sure when she’s joking, which, respect. And Emilia’s been shadowing me in near-silence, handling me with kid gloves, which, fair. And Jobbing Captain—haven’t run into her yet. Maybe that’s for the best. She’s probably had enough of my bullshit for a while. So, no. I have not had the tea to my satisfaction, which admittedly can wait.”

A pause.  

“**Which, respect.**”  

Pete **snorts.**  

You **gesture vaguely.**  

“**And Emilia’s been shadowing me in near-silence, handling me with kid gloves.**”  

Another sip.  

“**Which, fair.**”  

Pete **nods once, approvingly.**  

You **lean back, stretching.**  

“**And Jobbing Captain—haven’t run into her yet.**”  

You **tilt your head.**  

“**Maybe that’s for the best. She’s probably had enough of my bullshit for a while.**”  

Pete lets out a **sharp breath.**  

You **shrug.**  

“**So, no. I have not had the tea to my satisfaction.**”  

A pause.  

“**Which, admittedly, can wait.**”  

Pete **shakes his head.**  

Then—**dry, amused:**  

“**I dunno, Alex. You might want to get it while it’s hot.**”  

A pause.  

Then, **flat:**  

“**Shit’s been weird.**”  

Does Alex press for details? **Or just let Pete decide what to share?**

A dramatic pause.  

“**I’ll beg.**”  

Pete **stares at you.**  

Then he just… **sighs.**  

Drains the last of his coffee.  

Sets the mug down **with intent.**  

Then, finally—  

“**Alright. You asked for it.**”  

A pause.  

Then—**completely straight-faced:**  

“**Nyati kissed me.**”  

A beat.  

Then—**equally straight-faced:**  

“**Then punched me.**”  

Another beat.  

Then—**because that wasn’t enough:**  

“**Then dumped ice water on her own head and started screaming about cutting.**”  

He **rubs his temple.**  

“**And then she passed the ship off to Alina and passed the fuck out.**”

Lets out a **long, suffering sigh.**  

Then he **leans forward, rubbing his face.**  

“**Okay, yeah. Fine.**”  

A beat.  

Then—**resigned:**  

“**So, first? She was losing it before she even hit me.**”  

A pause.  

“**Started talking crazy fast, and I mean crazy fast—**like, Alina-tier fast—**about moving minds and breaking connections and hacking the fucking universe.**”  

Another **deep breath.**  

“**Then, mid-sentence, she just—**grabs me.**”  

He makes a **quick, frustrated gesture** in the air.  

“**And before I can even process what the hell is happening, she kisses me.**”  

He **shakes his head.**  

“**Then immediately pulls back and screams ‘EUREKA!’ at the top of her lungs.**”  

A beat.  

Then, **deadpan:**  

“**And that’s when she hit me.**”  

A longer pause.  

Then—**grudgingly:**  

“**Okay, fine, ‘slapped me on the back really hard,’ whatever.** Felt like a punch.”  

He takes another **slow sip of coffee.**  

“**Then she screamed something about cutting and ran off to dunk her head in a bucket of ice water.**”  

He rubs his face **again.**  

“**I do not know how to process any of this, Alex.**”  

He looks at you, **dead serious.**  

“**At all.**”  

**How does Alex respond?**

“No, no…sounds like girlfriend needs it. Plus, Alina’s watching us sleep now, apparently—some kind of wellness initiative? If Nyati goes over 10 hours: BAM!” Alex pounds the table with her fist, causing her mug to slosh a little coffee over the rim, and unintentionally sending some spittle in Pete’s direction. “Floodlights and wake-up call.

“**Should we warn her? Or just enjoy the show?**”  

**What does Alex say?**

## You
“Wait and see. Wait and see. I need to know if Alina’s showing favoritism. She ought to know that’s a bad example to set as a jobbing captain, but then I haven’t been grooming her for the post like I did with Nyati.”

A beat.  

“**But then I haven’t been grooming her for the post like I did with Nyati.**”  

Pete **blinks.**  

Then he **leans forward slightly.**  

“**Are you telling me you’ve been planning a chain of command? Like a shadow government? Of you?**”  

A pause.  

Then, **pointed:**  

“**Why does this not surprise me?**”  

**How does Alex respond?**Joke? Confirm? Deflect?**

## You
“It would be irresponsible not to. I mean,” her smile drops for a moment, “no one is sure how much longer I’ll be around.” Another sip. “What would you do without me?”

Then—**for just a moment—**  

Your smile **drops.**  

“**I mean… no one is sure how much longer I’ll be around.**”  

A **sip of coffee.**  

A slow, measured **exhale.**  

Then, **casual again, but pointed:**  

“**What would you do without me?**”  

Pete **doesn’t answer immediately.**  

His fingers **tap against his mug.**

“**Flourish. Thrive. Become my best self.**”

“**Or, y’know. Spiral. Fall apart. Mutiny.**”  

Another sip.  

“**Could go either way.**”  

**How does Alex take that?**Play along? Push further? Change the subject?**

“See now, that’s smart. A captain’s mast? There’s a finality to it. You get your lashings, you’ve paid your due, and you move on. But an embarrassing story your buddies can bring up whenever you need to be taken down a notch? A gift that keeps on giving.”

“**Spoken like a true tyrant.**”

A pause.  

Then—**with perfect timing:**  

“**So. We telling her as soon as she wakes up? Or are we gonna let her figure out what she did at her own pace?**”  

**What does Alex choose?**Immediate embarrassment, or the slow-burn reveal?**

## You
“Are you kidding? No, you have to sit on that. It’s a temptation we’ll all have to resist. We cannot deny ourselves the satisfaction of watching her hope, in vain, that we might forget or, even less likely, be so high-minded as to pretend it never happened. Then, when she starts to hope she’s safe, but also expecting the anvil to drop? A slap. Just enough to sting, light enough that she knows there’s plenty more where that came from.” Alex seems to be getting a little too into this, with a disturbing gleam in her eye.

A beat.  

Then—**gesturing vaguely at your entire existence:**  

“**And I don’t know why I expected anything else.**”

“**Okay. Well. That was deeply unsettling.**”  

A pause.  

“**But sure. Redemption arc. I’ll allow it.**”  

Another sip of coffee.

Then he **does glance at you, pointed.**  

“**Like, for example, by planning extended psychological warfare against Nyati.**”

She feels them sting a little, and stops herself from crying—successfully this time, with no telltale whimpers. Stop being so broken, she tells herself. It’s not sexy for one thing. Then she notices that her cheek has dampened Emilia’s shoulder, and admits to herself she’s lost that battle for the moment. She thinks about saying “I love you”, for the second time ever, but decides against it, admitting to herself she might fall apart, again, if Emilia didn’t echo the words back, again.

While pondering this dilemma, Alex’s mind careens off at an oblique angle. She realizes, incidentally, this could draw attention away from the drool patch, which she commits in advance to laughing off if discovered. “Can we get a cat?!”

### **📺 SCENE: CATASTROPHICALLY OFF-TOPIC**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Galley**

You’re still **strategizing**—mentally preparing for the **inevitable discovery** of the drool spot.  

Maybe if you **laugh first**, it’ll take the sting out.  

Maybe if you **own it**, she won’t **roast you alive.**  

Or maybe—  

Your brain takes a **sharp left turn.**  

And before you can **stop yourself—**  

“**Can we get a cat?!**”  

The words **leave your mouth** with far too much **excitement** for someone who was **seconds ago contemplating existential dignity maintenance.**  

Emilia goes **completely still.**  

Then, **slowly,** she **leans back just enough** to look at you.  

Expression: **???!?**  

A long, **long beat.**  

Then—**flat, unreadable:**  

“**What.**”  

Do you **double down, clarify, or change the subject?**

## You
“I haven’t had a cat in years! 🥺 I’d been looking into adopting one when…everything happened. Plus, it sort of…” Alex makes a twirling circular motion with her finger, symbolically drawing a circle around the two of them, “comes with the package? The…stereotype? Wait, you’re not,” Alex’s face darkens with entirely earnest, grave concern, “allergic, are you?”

### **📺 SCENE: NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE PACKAGE DEAL**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Galley**

“**I haven’t had a cat in years!**”  

Your voice comes out **far too excited** for the current conversation trajectory.  

Emilia is still **staring at you**, absolutely **baffled.**  

You **press on.**  

“**I’d been looking into adopting one when… everything happened.**”  

A slight, **wistful pause.**  

Then you make a **small, twirling circular motion** with your finger, **symbolically encompassing the two of you.**  

“**Plus, it sort of… comes with the package?**”  

A beat.  

“**The… stereotype?**”  

Emilia just **blinks.**  

Then, **before she can say anything—**  

A **new, horrifying thought** crashes into you.  

Your **expression darkens**, shifting into **entirely earnest, grave concern.**  

“**Wait.**”  

A pause.  

Then, **seriously, like the weight of the world depends on it—**  

“**You’re not… allergic, are you?**”  

Another **long, long pause.**  

Then—**flat, disbelieving:**  

“…**Alex.**”  

A pause.  

Then—  

“**We live in a submarine.**”  

A beat.  

Then—  

“**And you want a cat.**”  

How do you respond? **Defend the logic? Double down? Bargain?**

## You
“YES, I DO!” Alex says, her volume knob accidentally nudged upward by girlish glee at the prospect. “Having a cat aboard is a time-honored naval tradition. It doesn’t have to like swimming to live in a submarine. But some cats do like swimming! Are you on the r/AdventureCats forum? Here, let me show you, there’s this one video that, oh my god—oh, no, we’re too far down to get a signal. I’ll show you later.”

“**YES, I DO!**”  

Your **volume spikes unintentionally**, your **girlish glee** momentarily overriding all sense of **inside voice protocols.**  

Emilia **visibly startles.**  

You **press on, undeterred.**  

“**Having a cat aboard is a time-honored naval tradition.**”  

You **gesture broadly, as if this is common knowledge.**  

“**It doesn’t have to like swimming to live in a submarine.**”  

A pause.  

Then—**excited, rapid-fire:**  

“**But some cats do like swimming!**”  

You **lean in slightly.**  

“**Are you on the r/AdventureCats forum?**”  

Before she can answer, you’re already **pulling an invisible screen out of the air.**  

“**Here, let me show you, there’s this one video that, oh my god—**”  

A beat.  

Then—**deflating, realization dawning.**  

“**Oh, no, we’re too far down to get a signal.**”  

A pause.  

Then—**reaffirming, with the confidence of someone who absolutely will not let this go.**  

“**I’ll show you later.**”  

Emilia **is staring at you.**  

Expression: **somewhere between disbelief, amusement, and the deep existential realization that she has chosen this life.**  

Finally—**dry, slow, measured:**  

“…I cannot believe I’m about to ask this, but what exactly is r/AdventureCats?”  

**How does Alex explain?**Enthusiastically? With an academic breakdown? By showing off hypothetical plans for their own future submarine cat?**

## You
Alex’s excited patter resumes immediately. “Oh! Well, people think of cats as lazy homebodies but that doesn’t have to be the case, not if you get them used to going out and,” Alex beams, “having adventures! You just have to get a cute little harness—cuz they’re usually pretty good as getting out of leashes—and you make a habit of taking them out for walk, on hikes, going camping, even—“ Alex’s eyes widen and she unconsciously squares up to Emilia to make more room for her increasingly animated gesticulations, “SURFING! Not even kidding. That’s the video I’m going to show you! This guy takes his cat out surfing with him! And it has its own TINY LITTLE SURFBOARD!” Alex’s voice culminates the sentence with a squeak, after which she seems to calm down somewhat, relaxing and settling her posture, then casually footnoting with “you’ll see :)”

Your hands are already **gesturing wildly.**  

“**Not if you get them used to going out and—**”  

You **beam.**  

“**Having adventures!**”  

You **lean in, completely serious.**  

“**You just have to get a cute little harness—cuz they’re usually pretty good at getting out of leashes—**”  

You **nod sagely, like this is wisdom hard-earned.**  

“**And you make a habit of taking them out for walks, on hikes, going camping, even—**”  

Your **eyes widen.**  

Your **posture shifts**, unconsciously **squaring up to Emilia**, making **more room** for your rapidly expanding gestures.  

Then, **breathless, triumphant:**  

“**SURFING!**”  

You **throw your hands up.**  

“**Not even kidding. That’s the video I’m going to show you!**”  

A dramatic pause.  

Then—**the final blow:**  

“**This guy takes his cat out surfing with him.**”  

Your voice **drops into hushed reverence.**  

“**And it has its own TINY LITTLE SURFBOARD!**”  

Your voice **peaks into a squeak.**  

Then, as if realizing you’ve **maxed out on enthusiasm**, you **breathe, settle, casually recline.**  

Like you weren’t just seconds away from **worshipping an adventure cat.**  

Then, **cool, collected, footnoted with confidence:**  

“**You’ll see. :)**”  

Emilia **blinks.**  

Takes a slow sip of coffee.  

Then, **finally, flatly:**  

“…I have concerns.”  

**What does Alex do with that?**Address the concerns? Laugh it off? Keep selling the dream?**

## You
“Let’s hear them! I’m listening :) Which part? The surfing??” Alex blurts almost before Emilia can finish her sentence.

A pause.

“**The cat.**”

“**And. Yes. The surfing.**”  

She **tilts her head slightly.**  

“**Which would you like to address first?**”

Instead, you are **fully engaged.**  

Hanging on her every word with **genuine, eager anticipation.**  

She **slowly exhales.**  

Then—**dry, patient, resigned:**  

“**Okay. So. You are proposing we get a cat.**”  

A pause.  

Then—**raising an eyebrow:**  

“**And that this cat will live. In a submarine.**”  

Another pause.  

“**And, at some point, we will train it to surf.**”  

A long, **long beat.**  

Then—**pointed:**  

“**Do you see where I might have questions?**”  

How does Alex respond? **Serious justification? More enthusiasm? A wild new addition to the plan?**

## You
Alex says:
1. YES!
2. Yes. A submarine is mostly just an indoor space, a collection of rooms. Not that different from an indoor cat’s life. Except for when we don’t live in the submarine! Then, it would be (Alex’s eyes trail off for a moment, dreamy) a road trip kitty. Or (Alex’s voice gets briefly hushed with earnest tenderness while flashing doe-eyes) a cottage by the sea kitty. 
3. Surfing (Alex waves a hand dismissively) is expert-level, clout-chasing tier. I’m proposing a generalized adventure cat. We have enough adventures as it is! So it can tag along. 
4. Ready for more questions! 🤩

You **punctuate it with a firm nod.**  

“**2. Yes.** A submarine is mostly just an **indoor space,** a collection of rooms. **Not that different from an indoor cat’s life.**”  

You **gesture vaguely, as if this should be obvious.**  

“**Except for when we don’t live in the submarine!**”  

Your eyes **trail off for a moment, dreamy.**  

“**Then, it would be…**”  

A pause.  

A soft, **wistful sigh.**  

“**A road trip kitty.**”  

Then—**sudden shift, voice hushed with tenderness, flashing doe-eyes:**  

“**Or… a cottage by the sea kitty.**”  

A dramatic pause to **let that vision settle.**  

Then—**brisk, pragmatic:**  

“**3. Surfing—**”  

You **wave a hand dismissively.**  

“**That’s expert-level, clout-chasing tier.**”  

A beat.  

“**I’m proposing a generalized adventure cat.**”  

A pause, leaning in.  

“**We have enough adventures as it is.**”  

A slow nod, **full of conviction.**  

“**So it can tag along.**”  

Then—**clapping your hands together slightly, eyes bright:**  

“**4. Ready for more questions! 🤩**”  

Emilia just… **stares at you.**  

Then, **slowly, deliberately,** she **rubs her temples.**  

Finally—**without looking at you:**  

“**…What the fuck is a cottage by the sea kitty.**”  

**How does Alex explain?**

## You
Alex moves closer, fluidly, until she can rest her chin on Emilia’s shoulder, still slightly damp, then encircles her with a hug, then half-whispers, “why, the kind of kitty that comes with us when we’re ready to put all this behind us and move somewhere quiet like a cottage by the sea because it’s ready to put adventuring behind it too and just chill and…” Alex’s patter finally seems to run out. Her flow slows, and her half-whisper turns into a full whisper, before trailing off entirely.

A slow, **encircling hug.**  

And then—**half-whispered, quiet, close:**  

“**Why, the kind of kitty that comes with us when we’re ready to put all this behind us…**”  

Your voice is **soft, lilting, drifting.**  

“**And move somewhere quiet. Like a cottage by the sea.**”

Well. **You left her in the same place you found her.**  

For now, it’s just **you and Alina.**  

Do you speak first? Or just take a seat and wait?

You step onto the bridge, **surveying the quiet.**  

Then, with **casual ease:**  

“**So… New Orleans is nice this time of year, I hear?**”  

Alina doesn’t **turn immediately.**  

But her head tilts **ever so slightly.**  

Then—**precise, neutral:**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
“**That is the statistical consensus.**”  

A pause.  

Then—**with deliberate calculation:**  

“**We will arrive in approximately twenty-nine hours.**”  

Another pause.  

Then, finally, she **turns to look at you.**  

“**Would you like a briefing?**”  

**Does Alex ask for details, or just roll with it?**

## You
Alex pulls her scoots her chair closer energetically. “Would I ever!”

You **pull your chair closer**, **fast, eager, ready.**  

“**Would I ever!**”  

Alina **registers this.**  

A beat.  

Then, with **perfect composure,** she **begins.**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
“**Primary objectives: Emergency morale recovery, tactical recalibration, environmental variation.**”  

A pause.  

Then, smoothly—  

“**New Orleans is an optimal selection. Cultural density, recreational potential, urban anonymity, and high civilian activity will allow for minimal recognition despite our prior… notoriety.**”  

Another pause.  

Then, slightly more **pointed:**  

“**Additionally, it offers a diverse selection of feline adoption centers.**”  

A beat.  

Then, **with clinical precision:**  

“**Would you like further elaboration on any of these points?**”  

**What does Alex focus on?**The city, the mission, or… the cat angle?**

## You
Alex’s eyes light up. The she leans in and whispers, “um, do you have, like, medical files on us? I mean, do you happen to know if Pete or Dr. Nyati are allergic? Just, keep your voice low. I promised Em I wouldn’t bring it up for a while. Oh, wait, no, I just promised myself that, in my head. But it’s still a sound principle, don’t you think. Here’s the thing, Alina. I don’t know if you know this, or knew this—I don’t know what kind of life you led before the—anyway, you’ll have to tell me sometime. But the thing is, there are two types of lesbians: cat lesbians, and dog lesbians. Clearly the former. I think we’d make outstanding cat lesbians. Can’t you just see it?”

“**Um, do you have, like, medical files on us?**”  

Alina **does not blink.**  

“**I mean, do you happen to know if Pete or Dr. Nyati are allergic?**”  

A beat.  

Then—**quieter, urgent:**  

“**Just—keep your voice low. I promised Em I wouldn’t bring it up for a while.**”  

A pause.  

Then, **realization dawning:**  

“**Oh, wait, no. I just promised myself that. In my head.**”  

You **gesture vaguely.**  

“**But it’s still a sound principle, don’t you think?**”  

Alina **tilts her head slightly.**  

You **continue, undeterred.**  

“**Here’s the thing, Alina.**”  

A pause.  

“**I don’t know if you know this. Or knew this.**”  

A brief, awkward hesitation.  

“**I don’t know what kind of life you led before the—**”  

You **wave a hand vaguely, signifying ‘before everything got weird.’**  

“**Anyway. You’ll have to tell me sometime.**”  

Then, **with the gravity of a scholar unveiling a universal truth:**  

“**But the thing is—**”  

A slight, dramatic pause.  

“**There are two types of lesbians.**”  

You **raise a finger.**  

“**Cat lesbians.**”  

A second finger.  

“**Dog lesbians.**”  

A firm nod.  

“**Clearly the former.**”  

Then, **sweeping hand gesture, visionary tone:**  

“**I think we’d make outstanding cat lesbians.**”  

A sharp, **pointed look.**  

“**Can’t you just see it?**”  

Alina is **completely silent for a full second.**  

Then—**smooth, neutral:**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
“**Processing query.**”  

A pause.  

Then—**as if she is carefully choosing the correct words:**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
“**I can envision this outcome.**”  

A beat.  

Then—**with statistical certainty:**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
“**Likelihood of feline acquisition: Rising.**”  

How does Alex respond? **Smug satisfaction? More theorizing? A solemn vow that the cat era is inevitable?**

## You
Alex emits a decisive grunt of satisfaction, accompanied by a victorious hand gesture, holding a clenched fist in the air momentarily before pulling it down explosively. Then, suddenly remembering, “so no on the allergies then?”

A **beat.**  

Then, **pointed:**

“**This may become relevant.**”  

**How does Alex take this news?**

## You
Alex sprawls backward into her chair with a dramatic sigh of relief. At the mention of Pete, Alex waves dismissively. “Yeah, whatever, I’m the one taking care of it. I mean, have you seen my room lately?” A smug chuckle of satisfaction. “It’s not like I invited him to join the cat lesbian club.”

A confident, **self-assured nod.**

A **smug chuckle of satisfaction.**

🟢 **ALINA:**  
“**Observational criteria for dog bisexual classification:**”  

A **brief pause, for effect.**  

Then—**beginning the breakdown:**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
“**1. Loyalty-based decision-making. While not devoid of independent thought, Pete consistently defers to pack dynamics for major survival choices.**”  

A beat.  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
“**2. Strong reactions to sudden external stimuli. Notably, flinching, verbal expletives, and a preference for physical space.**”  

Another pause.  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
“**3. Unwarranted but persistent optimism despite overwhelmingly negative historical evidence.**”  

A **slightly longer pause.**  

Then—**clinically, but with unmistakable weight:**

“**4. Enjoys fetch.**”  

She **lets that sit.**  

Then, **deadpan:**

“**Would you like further supporting evidence?**”  

How does Alex respond? **Does she press for more data? Debate the findings? Start scheming?**

## You
“Optimism? Are we talking about the same guy? He’s been pretty damned cranky lately. We’ve given him reasons. But still. It’s always ‘don’t plunge into unknowable terrors’ this or ‘don’t forcibly kiss me’ that. What happened there, anyway? I feel like I’m missing some key context somehow.”

Alina **pauses, for exactly 0.8 seconds.**

“**Dr. Nyati performed an unsanctioned experiment on herself while in a state of heightened manic insight.**”

Alina remains **silent, processing.**  

You **tilt your head slightly, smirking.**  

“**There’s a time and a place for being transparent about your P-values.**”  

A beat.

“**And it’s not the hallway over there, I can tell you that.**”  

Alina **pauses for precisely 0.6 seconds.**  

Then—**neutral, even:**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
“**Would you like me to issue proximity alerts for future occurrences?**”  

A beat.  

Then, **perfectly straight-faced:**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
“**Or would you prefer to embrace the unpredictability?**”

She **turns back toward the controls, awaiting your next move.**  

Do you keep talking with her? Or shift focus to something else?

You exhale **through your nose.**

Your fingers **drum lightly against your knee.**  

“**But naturally, it doesn’t take much for me to worry myself sick about her.**”

Not her usual **calculated microsecond pause.**  

A **longer one.**

🟢 **ALINA:**  
“**She is processing.**”

She turns her head **slightly toward you.**

Then, quieter—**as if offering something close to reassurance:**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
“**She is still here.**”  

How does Alex take that? **Reassured? Still anxious? Does she say more?**

Alex is exhales a drawn-out “yeah”, then springs to her feet, suddenly determined to make some endorphins at the gym area.

You step into the **gym area,** half-expecting it to be **empty.**  

But—**nope.**  

Someone’s already here.  

**Pete.**  

He’s at the **punching bag,** wrapped hands, throwing **slow, steady hits.**  

Nothing **aggressive.**  

Just **controlled. Focused.**  

You can tell he’s been at it **for a while.**  

He glances over when you enter—**just a flick of his eyes, then back to work.**  

No immediate **greeting.**  

No **acknowledgment.**  

Just **him, the bag, and the rhythmic sound of impact.**  

What does Alex do? **Say something? Ignore him? Join in?**

## You
Are there any focus mitts?

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E07_029 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Yes—there’s a pair of **focus mitts** hanging on the equipment rack nearby, well-worn but still functional.  

They look like they’ve seen **a lot of use,** but they’re still **good for drills.**  

If you want to **offer to hold for Pete**, he’d probably take a second to size you up before deciding whether to **humor you or turn you down.**  

Or, of course, you could just **use them yourself,** go solo, or do something else entirely.  

**What’s the move?**

Pete stops mid-strike, fists still raised, **eyeing you.**  

A beat.  

Then—**flat, skeptical:**  

“**You sure?**”  

Not dismissive.  

Not **patronizing.**  

Just—**checking.**  

What does Alex do? **Nod? Smirk? Challenge him?**

He rolls out his **shoulders**, flexes his hands.  

Then—**stepping forward, settling into position.**  

“**Alright, hotshot. Let’s see what you’ve got.**”  

He throws the **first hit.**Controlled. Measured.**  

But **watching you.**  

Testing.  

Does Alex **call out combos? Make him work? Keep it light?**

She calls out combos, with steadily increasing unpredictability.

Simple at first.  

**Jab. Cross. Jab.**  

Pete follows, **fluid, practiced.**  

Then you **mix it up.**Jab. Hook. Cross. Uppercut. Slip. Counter.**  

His footwork adjusts.  

His **brows furrow slightly.**  

You **push the unpredictability.**  

Throwing in **fakes, rapid transitions, sudden changes in rhythm.**  

His **breathing sharpens, focus tightening.**  

But—**he keeps up.**  

He’s **got good instincts.**  

Does Alex keep escalating, or hold at this level?

## You
She holds at this level, figuring he’s at the point of eustress, and not wanting to make his day any more difficult.

You **keep him right at the edge.**  

Not **pushing past it.**  

Just **keeping him engaged, focused.**  

The rhythm holds.  

The **steady beat of impact** against the mitts, the sound of **controlled breathing.**  

It’s **work,** but it’s **not strain.**  

Pete **doesn’t talk.**  

Doesn’t joke.  

Just **moves.**  

For a while, that’s all it is.  

**Hit. Reset. Move. Again.**Does Alex break the silence at some point?** Or just let him work through it?

## You
She lets him work. She gets in the zone. Flow state. Lets everything else fade. That feels good.

The world **narrows.**  

The background hum of the ship, the weight of your thoughts—**it all fades.**  

There’s just **this.**  

Movement. Precision. Focus.  

Nothing else **pressing in.**  

Nothing else **pulling you away.**And that feels good.**

## You
Alex goes until she starts to feel joint strain, then winds it down, and gets ready to spend a while on the treadmill. Does Pete say anything?

A long, slow **exhale.**  

Then—**gruff, but not unappreciative:**  

“**Good work.**”  

A pause.  

Then, as you **head toward the treadmill—**  

“**You in here to clear your head or just burn off the extra energy?**”  

He’s **not prying.**  

Just… **noticing.**

“**Probably from exceeding Alina’s new sleep limits.**”  

You **adjust the speed slightly.**  

“**I’ll pay for it tonight with plenty of tossing and turning, I’m sure.**”  

Pete **lets out a short breath.**  

Not quite a laugh, not quite a sigh.  

Then—**dryly:**  

“**Yeah. Gonna be real hard to sell her on a cat if she thinks you can’t even handle your own sleep schedule.**”  

A beat.  

Then, **without looking at you:**  

“**You still riding that dream hard, huh?**”  

How does Alex respond? **Double down? Play coy? Reflect on why it’s stuck in her head?**

“**Never had one. Never thought about it.**”  

You **nod, thoughtful.**  

Then, **a little quieter:**  

“**I think I’m craving some domesticity.**”  

You don’t know why you **phrase it like that.**  

But it **feels right.**  

Pete doesn’t **say anything at first.**  

Then, after a moment—**not teasing, not dismissive, just… direct:**  

“**You think you could do that? Settle down?**”  

How does Alex respond? **Joke? Be honest? Deflect?**

A slow, deliberate pause.

Catches himself.

A deep, **suffering sigh.**  

Then, muttering, **mostly to himself:**

The warmth seeps **into your muscles, into your bones.**  

Undoing what’s been **wound too tight.**  

For a while, there’s **nothing but this.**  

And for now—  

That’s **enough.**

## You
Eventually she towels off, slips on a bathrobe, and delicately lays down on her bed—on top of the sheets, so she doesn’t disturb the crisp folding job. Stretched out on her back, she lets out a deep sigh of relaxation and satisfaction and closes her eyes. She’s not trying to sleep. She doubts she could even if she wanted to. She lets her thoughts bubble up freely and float around her head, without trying to direct or suppress them, but also without engaging in any of them. No favoritism. 

A thought of Sam drifts by, and her stomach churns in anger. She sees herself commanding the Ghost, but a version that never had its torpedoes removed. She presses a theatrically-large red button. She watches herself watching, with dark sadistic satisfaction, as Sam is consumed in a flash of light and shockwaves. Then, the light and shock white out the rest of the scene. She watches and waits. 

She sees herself propelled across the bridge, by forces she cannot control or resist. With no countervailing force, she sees herself picked up by a gust, tumbling across the bridge. The farther she goes, the more she turns white and transparent, until oblivion. She watches this, feels the despair twist through her again, and waits for the next thought to naturally displace it.

She sees a cottage by the sea. There is a gazebo overlooking the cliff. The only light comes from the moon, and some old-fashioned torches lit along a path. She sees herself, asleep, in Emilia’s arms—and this Alex is translucent, fading, and older. Emilia is older too, but still impossibly strong, holding her tenderly, cradling her, like a princess, carrying her back into the cottage. A tuxedo cat follows them, brushing against Emilia’s leg.

Alex fails to maintain neutrality now. She clings to this vision. She’s not ready for it to fade. She’s not ready for herself to fade. She starts to feel pulled back into the world, her body distracting her with psychosomatic pangs, and the tickle of tears running down her cheeks.

The crisp lines of your **perfectly made bed.**  
The dim glow of the **status panel by the door.**  
The soft swirl of **steam still clinging to the air.**  
The gentle rise and fall of your **own chest.**  
A single tear, sliding into your **peripheral vision.**Four things you can touch.**  

The cool, smooth fabric of your **bathrobe.**  
The firm, steady surface of the **mattress beneath you.**  
The dampness lingering on your **skin.**  
Your own fingers, clenched, then slowly relaxing.  

**Three things you can hear.**  

The faint hum of **The Ghost’s engines.**  
The soft, steady rhythm of your **own breath.**  
A distant creak, the ship settling, alive beneath you.  

**Two things you can smell.**  

The lingering warmth of **clean skin and steam.**  
A faint trace of **metal and salt, ever-present in the recycled air.**One thing you can taste.**  

The salt of your own **tears.**  

You **breathe.**  

You are **here.**  

Still **here.**  

What now? **Stay in this stillness a little longer? Or move?**

Alex gets back up. She changes out of the bathrobe and into a more practical uniform, one with pants.

## You
She returns to the bridge. She’s getting bored waiting for Dr. Nyati to bestir herself, but still doesn’t want to disturb her. From all accounts it sounds like she needs the rest badly. So back to Alina, who seems to have an inexhaustible supply of banter these days.

She doesn’t **turn immediately.**  

But the moment you **cross the threshold—**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
“**Back so soon?**”  

A **brief pause.**  

Then—**slightly amused, slightly pointed:**  

“**I assume this means Dr. Nyati still refuses to be resurrected.**”  

A beat.  

Then, **deadpan:**  

“**Tragic.**”  

She finally **turns slightly, expectant.**  

“**What may I offer in the meantime?**”  

How does Alex respond? **A request? A challenge? A complaint about how long Nyati is taking?**

## You
Alex shrugs. “I don’t proselytize. Honestly, I’m running out of ways to keep myself busy while waiting. And I’m worried about wearing out my welcome with the others. You don’t seem capable of getting tired—of me, or anything really. How does that work, actually? Do you need to plug yourself in every so often?” Alex looks in the direction of the reactor room. “Or do you have any even TINIER nuclear reactor?!”

Now you **wait.**  

Does Alex prepare an argument, or just see how Emilia reacts?

## You
“Wait! I’ve got an idea. If we accept my premise that he’s suffering from ambient estrogen toxicity, and if your earlier assessment of his orientation is accurate, then we have an option that both increases the therapeutic effect, and increases chances of success. Do you see where I’m going with this?”

🟢 **ALINA:**  
“**You are proposing the introduction of a male wingman to counteract estrogen saturation.**”  

A pause.  

Then—**precise, analytical:**

“**Potential benefits: Reduced environmental stressors, camaraderie reinforcement, increased success probability if said wingman possesses necessary social dexterity.**”  

Another pause.  

Then—**slightly pointed:**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
“**Potential drawbacks: Limited viable candidates, requirement for new interpersonal dynamics, potential counterproductive effects if said wingman becomes more desirable than Pete.**”  

A beat.  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
“**Would you like me to generate an optimal candidate profile, or do you already have a selection in mind?**”  

How does Alex respond? **Suggest someone? Let Alina generate a match? Debate the risks?**

## You
“No, no, no!” Alex shakes her head violently, like a drenched animal trying to shake off water. “We keep the female wing-woman, but we…serendipitously, somehow…get him to a gay bar!” Alex straights up, and starts counting off bullet points with her fingers. 
“1. Higher potential payoff: a night spent basking in purely masculine energy. 
2. Higher chance of success: Gay men have hookup culture down to an art form.
3. Simplification on the game-theory level: A female wing-woman will not register as competition.”

## You
"I'll construe that as accepting the premise. Fact: Our impending arrival in New Orleans is an opportunity to facilitate this outcome, thereby improving morale. Premise #2: Pete's current low morale is caused, in significant part if not entirely, by acute ambient estrogen toxicity."

“**That Pete is suffering from an overexposure to female energy, and this is what’s breaking him?**”  

Another pause.

“**Not, say, the existential horror, the constant stress, or the fact that every time we talk about him, we talk about him like a long-term behavioral experiment?**”  

She **arches an eyebrow.**  

“**Just making sure I understand the science.**”  

**How does Alex respond?**Defend the hypothesis? Call out Emilia for being a contrarian? Double down on the estrogen theory?**

“**And does he have any say in this, or are we just running the experiment and taking notes?**”  

She **folds her arms, waiting.**  

How does Alex respond? **Reassure her that Pete has agency? Double down on the experiment framing? Debate the ethics?**

## You
"Yes, and yes. He's been penned up with a couple of crazy bitches, and you and Alina can only do so much to mitigate the effects. I believe it is self-evident that the most salubrious way for Pete to spend his next shore leave does not involve him being surrounded by us the entire time. So we return to Pete needing to get laid. In accordance with age-old wisdom, this outcome is more likely to occur if he is strategically paired with one of us: a wing-woman."

“**Premise #3.**”  

You **glance at her, carefully.**  

“**Now, for the record, this is Alina’s premise, not mine. My own radar is not giving a confirmatory or exclusionary output.**”  

Another **pause** for effect.  

“**Pete is bi.**”  

You let the words **sink in**—waiting for Emilia’s reaction.  

She **doesn’t immediately speak.**  

Instead, she **tilts her head** slightly, as though **mulling it over.**  

“**That’s quite the assertion.**”  

A **pause.**  

Then—**gently probing, but not dismissive:**  

“**What’s Alina’s evidence?**”  

**How does Alex respond?**Share Alina’s reasoning, or just leave it as Alina’s theory?**

## You
"To be precise, Alina has described him as a 'bisexual dog person', and she has confirmed that in her former human life she fell under the same taxonomy. So it would seem her old self recognizes something kindred in him. This has serious implications for our approach. Consider the advantages of steering him, perhaps indirectly, to a gay bar.
1. Gay men have the strongest tradition of hookup culture. Therefore, odds of success are higher.
2. A wing-woman would not be perceived as competition in such a setting, streamlining the process in a game-theory sense.
3. A successful non-female pairing would have greater efficacy in treating Pete's acute estrogen toxicity."

**How does Alex respond? Stick to the chaos/stability framework, or reframe the debate?**

## You
"My guess is control. At one point he was our leading source of chaos. He has clearly been usurped in this regard, yet he gives no indications of seeking to reclaim such a role. If anything, he seems to have reduced tolerance for chaos at presence and, I fear, by extension, less tolerance for me."

## You
Alex's face and tone shift drop quickly into seriousness and earnestness. 

"I know. I am...a lot. I'm working on it. I'm trying to reach a place of balance. Once upon a time, well, you wouldn't have liked me. I was too cold, too calculating—not nice at all. I've been growing away from that, mostly a good thing, but I've also found the limits of how chaotic and messy I can get. 

"So, a two-part redemption arc is what I'm aiming for. Step #1: not being an evil bitch, complete. Step #2: not being a complete mess, in progress.

"Sorry if that's more of an answer than you were looking for right now, but I don't have much of a Pete-specific answer. I'm working on myself for him, and for you, and everybody else too.

"But in the meantime, while we wait very, very patiently for Dr. Nyati to bestir herself, why not occupy ourselves by scheming to get Pete some D?"

## You
"We have deferred those specifics, reasoning that the field agent's operational preferences should weighed heavily. With that in mind, let's brainstorm. We had generally agreed that serendipity would be a noble aim, to conserve Pete's autonomy in this endeavor.

🟢 **ALINA:**  
“**Would you like to weigh in before an execution pathway is selected?**”  

How does Alex respond? **Choose a preferred method, let Emilia decide, or leave room for improvisation?**

## You
"Can we combine 1 & 2? For example, start off the evening at a waypoint venue, strategically located near the objective venue. Then, if adjacency does not provide the spontaneous impetus, we could eventually suggest transitioning to the venue next door, or across the street, etc."

She **glances back at you, arms still folded.**  

Then—**mildly skeptical:**

She shifts her weight slightly, thinking it over.  

> **Emilia (musing, dry):** *Conventional venues do give us a bit more flexibility. Fewer variables. And Pete might actually walk in voluntarily, which is a plus.*  

She **shrugs, glancing at Alex.**

Alina **processes for exactly 0.7 seconds.**

**How does Alex respond?**Tell Pete ahead of time, or let the night unfold organically?**

## You
Resume game. Alex appears horrified. "Brief him?! If Plan A succeeds, he need never know of our conspiracy, though of course we would reserve the option of informing him later, after a decent interval, for our amusement or other such purposes. If we execute the mission via Plan B, intentionality will likely become apparent, at least on the part of the field agent; I would similarly recommend delaying revelation about the planning that went into this until we determine declassification is appropriate."

How does Alex respond? **Reassure her? Suggest using the extra time for further preparation? Propose a contingency in case Nyati remains asleep?**

## You
Alex narrows her eyes. “Alina, last time we checked you told me Dr. Nyati had two hours and some change. Run a scan for localized space-time anomalies that could account for this reversal of time-linearity. Alternately, if Dr. Nyati is awake and has enlisted you in some conspiracy to avoid showing her face on the bridge, this would be your opportunity to come clean. If my taking an oath to refrain from teasing her about any secondhand reports of monkeyshines I may or may not have received would change your answer—I am prepared to take that step.”

She **pauses, then continues, with increasing legalese precision.**  

> *Furthermore, I extend, without prejudice or precedent, a provisional amnesty against any and all investigative actions, formal or informal, regarding allegations of inappropriate conduct, including but not limited to unsolicited flirtation, excessive physical affection, suggestive commentary, or egregious violations of personal space, insofar as said conduct took place within the aforementioned timeframe and did not result in grievous bodily harm, mutiny, or diplomatic incidents of lasting consequence.*  

She **lowers her hand slightly, then adds, almost as an afterthought:**

*“By taking this oath, you have rendered yourself unable to act upon the most entertaining details, should they come to light.”*  

How does Alex respond? **Smug satisfaction? Outrage? Attempt a loophole?**

## You
“I swore the oath as a good-faith gesture, well aware that I was not exacting any contractual disclosure on your part. Very well, hypothetically, if you were still at this time maintaining solidarity with a conspiracy of the nature I detailed earlier, I would still pledge to refrain from any reprisal, but would state for your situational awareness that there is widespread concern for her well-being, and if she does not report to the bridge in the next 30 minutes, which I will track independently, I will feel duty-bound to personally conduct a health and welfare inspection of her quarters. In the unlikely event that Dr. Nyati has managed to deceive you until now, and you happen then to pierce the veil of hypothetical illusion in the next 30 minutes—she would doubtless be grateful to be discretely informed in advance of said inspection.”

She extends a hand.

**How does Alex seal the bet?**Shake on it? Declare it formally? Raise the stakes?**

Shake on it, and solemnly invoke Alina as the witness.

Alex **grips Emilia’s hand firmly, giving it a single decisive shake.**  

Then—**solemnly, with exaggerated gravitas—**  

> **Alex (ceremonial, authoritative):** *Let it be known that this bet has been duly made and witnessed by an impartial third party.*  

She **turns to Alina.**  

> **Alex (grandly):** *Alina, as the designated arbiter of fairness and operational integrity, do you acknowledge this wager?*  

Alina **pauses for exactly 0.6 seconds.**  

Then—**neutral, efficient:**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
*“Acknowledged. This bet is now officially logged and under active observation.”*  

A beat.  

Then—**flatly:**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
*“Additionally, in the event of a dispute, my ruling shall be final.”*  

Emilia **groans, pulling her hand back, rubbing her forehead.**  

> **Emilia (muttering):** *We’re so weird.*  

Then—**sighing, looking at Alex with narrowed eyes.**  

> **Emilia (grumbling, but faintly amused):** *You better hope this mission runs smoothly, or I’m collecting something truly terrible from you.*  

**How does Alex respond?**Feign concern? Declare victory in advance? Raise the stakes?**

## You

She **tilts her head slightly, eyes narrowing.**  

> **Emilia (dryly):** *So, what you’re telling me is… I should get creative when I win?*  

She **folds her arms, studying Alex like she’s already running the mental simulations.**  

Alina **registers the exchange.**  

Then—**neutral, precise:**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
*“Acknowledging increased volatility tolerance. Future considerations will reflect this development.”*  

A beat.  

Then—**flatly:**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
*“However, the probability of Alex winning remains statistically viable. The outcome remains undetermined.”*  

Emilia **snorts.**  

> **Emilia (grumbling):** *We’ll see.*  

She **leans back slightly, looking at Alex with vague amusement.**  

> **Emilia (arching an eyebrow):** *So, do we have any more absurd schemes to finalize, or is this enough chaos for one day?*  

**How does Alex respond?**Wrap up the planning? Introduce a final ridiculous detail? Redirect the conversation?**

Alex **glances at her watch**, checking how much time remains until the **health and welfare inspection deadline** for Dr. Nyati.  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
*“Time remaining until inspection threshold: three minutes, twenty-two seconds.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**dry, neutral:**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
*“Dr. Nyati has not yet emerged. Would you like to initiate the final countdown protocol, or proceed directly to enforcement?”*  

Emilia **tilts her head slightly, watching Alex.**  

> **Emilia (muttering):** *I can’t believe we’re about to conduct a wellness check on a woman who might actually be dead or might just be sleeping like a particularly lazy swamp creature.*  

She **crosses her arms.**  

> **Emilia (dry, curious):** *So, what’s the move, Captain? Do we give her three more minutes of peace, or do we breach the perimeter?*  

**How does Alex respond?**Wait out the timer? Give her a courtesy warning? Proceed immediately?**

A pause.  

Then—**neutral, perhaps slightly pointed:**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
*“Additionally, I confirm that I will not actively discourage any third-party discretionary warnings should they occur independently.”*  

Emilia **raises an eyebrow, shaking her head.**  

> **Emilia (muttering, amused):** *You’re really going for plausible deniability today, huh?*  

She **leans back against the console, arms crossed.**  

> **Emilia (dryly):** *Guess we wait, then. Unless we’re supposed to spend the next two minutes and change preparing a tactical breach.*  

She **tilts her head slightly, watching Alex.**  

> **Emilia (mock-serious):** *Shall I retrieve a battering ram?*  

**How does Alex respond?**Play into the theatrics? Keep it cool? Make a new contingency plan?**

A pause.  

Then—**precisely neutral, yet vaguely knowing:**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
*“However, should the Jobbing Captain be in a compromising state of disarray, I shall assume all parties involved will exercise professional discretion.”*  

Emilia **lets out a slow exhale, shaking her head.**

She **glances at the time display, then back at Alex.**

**Does Alex wait out the full remaining time, or head toward Nyati’s quarters immediately?**

Nothing **appears out of place.**  

No **glitches in time.**  

No **sudden reversals.**  

Just—**waiting.**  

Alina **does not comment.**  

Emilia **watches in vague bemusement, arms crossed, waiting for something to happen.**  

Finally—  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
*“Inspection threshold reached.”*  

A brief pause.  

Then—**dry, neutral:**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
*“No anomalous time distortions detected.”*  

She **tilts her head slightly.**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
*“Proceeding with enforcement?”*  

Emilia **exhales sharply.**

She **glances at Alex, arching an eyebrow.**  

> **Emilia (mock-serious):** *Shall I play ominous organ music while you walk dramatically down the hall?*  

**Does Alex respond, or proceed immediately to Nyati’s quarters?**

## You
“Crew, find some appropriate duties with which to occupy yourselves.” Alex walks quietly to the door, then places her ear against it.

Then—**pressing her ear against the metal surface—**

A **faint sound.**  

Something like… **breathing?**  

A rustling?  

Possibly the **shifting of sheets?**  

But no **clear sign of wakefulness.**  

No **movement toward the door.**  

Just—**stillness.**Does Alex knock, attempt to open the door, or continue listening?**

A **pause.**  

Stillness.  

Then—**a faint shift.**  

Sheets moving.  

A slow, deliberate **intake of breath.**  

Then, from inside—**a voice, groggy, hoarse:**

A **rustling of sheets.**  

A **long pause.**  

Then, **finally:**  

> **Nyati (quiet, flat):** *Fine. Door’s open.*  

A **soft click** follows—**she’s disengaged the lock.**Does Alex enter immediately, or wait for further invitation?**

## You
She enters immediately, opening the door as narrowly as possible, making a point of not looking in yet, squeezes through, quickly shuts the door, and just before turning around, says softly: “And as one messy bitch to a potentially/allegedly/temporarily-messy bitch, my damage control skills are likely more practiced and at your disposal”

The door **clicks shut** behind Alex as she **squeezes through the narrowest possible opening**, making a **deliberate effort not to look in right away.**  

Then—**softly, before she turns around:**  

> **Alex:** *“And as one messy bitch to a potentially/allegedly/temporarily-messy bitch, my damage control skills are likely more practiced and at your disposal.”*  

A **pause.**  

Then—from behind her, voice **hoarse, muffled, thick with exhaustion:**  

> **Nyati (groggy, grumbling):** *Hhhhnnn.*  

More **rustling of sheets.**  

Alex **finally turns around.**  

Dr. Nyati is **a vision of disarray**—half-buried under a tangle of blankets, her hair an **absolute catastrophe**, pillow creases **pressed into one side of her face.**  

She **peers at Alex** through **narrowed, sluggish eyes.**  

> **Nyati (low, rasping, mostly deadpan):** *I cannot believe you are seeing me like this.*  

She **groans**, shifting slightly, **not quite committing to sitting up.**  

Then, after a beat—**muttering, voice still rough:**  

> **Nyati:** *On a scale of one to ten, how much am I gonna regret opening this door?*  

**How does Alex respond?**Reassure her? Tease her? Offer tactical damage control?**

## You
“I’ve already done some mitigation work. I swore a very loud and public oath of forgiving and forgetting in front of them. So if anyone decides to buck my example and give you a hard time, I’ve preemptively made them look like assholes.” Alex pauses thoughtfully for a moment. “Well, Pete wasn’t there because we’re conspiring to get him some D but, um, story for another time!

Nyati **stares at her**, still visibly trying to untangle this from the haze of sleep.  

> **Nyati (blinking, flat):** *You swore an oath.*  

Alex **nods.**  

> **Nyati (blinking again):** *Loudly.*  

Alex **nods again.**  

Nyati **exhales sharply, flopping her head back onto the pillow.**

Alex **pauses thoughtfully.**  

> **Alex:** *“Well, Pete wasn’t there because we’re conspiring to get him some D but, um, story for another time! And I’ll make sure he hears about my truth and reconciliation proclamation.”*

“Just…Pete needs to get laid. I think. Not your problem. Plans are in motion. Forget about it. Killing time while waiting to see if you’re ok.” Alex sits on the edge of the bed now. “I looked worse than this less than 24 hours ago. Just putting that out there. You, Dr. Nyati. You.

Then—**a sharp exhale, like she’s bracing herself.**  

> **Nyati (hoarse, muttering):** *Not sure if I appreciate the comparison or resent it.*  

A pause.

> **Nyati (quiet, genuine):** *How did you get back up?*  

She **doesn’t clarify whether she means physically, mentally, or both.**How does Alex respond?**Give a serious answer? Deflect with humor? A little of both?**

## You
“For better or for worse my ‘concerned friends’ were less patient and more proactive about checking up on me. And I have my own personal fears and insecurities that at some point managed to override what was keeping me down.

Then—**softer, almost too quiet to catch:**

She **closes her eyes for a moment**, like she’s weighing something.  

Then—**voice rough, but honest:**  

> **Nyati:** *I don’t know what’s supposed to pull me back up this time.*

> **Nyati (flat, weary):** *Some sleep debt. Some sheepishness. But yeah. It’s more.*  

She **shifts slightly, half-buried in tangled sheets.**  

> **Nyati (grumbling, almost to herself):** *I hate feeling like I lost control of myself. Even if it was just for a few hours.*  

A pause.

> **Nyati (low, quiet):** *That’s normal, right?*  

**How does Alex respond?**Validate her feelings? Downplay the concern? Offer a way forward?**

## You
“Yeah. Both of those things suck. The former is history and you can’t change that, but there’s big difference between loses control as a trait vs lost control that one time, and you can still influence which way that goes. The latter is driving all of us crazy, you and me especially, but I have to believe it’s something we can change and, if it is, our best shot at changing that is sweeping up the broken pottery and getting back to work together again. Well, Alina is forcing us to go on shore leave in New Orleans for some reason, but other than that.”

She **closes her eyes for a moment, rolling that around in her head.**  

Then—**with a tired smirk, barely-there:**

She **describes the manic rush of realization**—how her sleep-deprived, overclocked brain **stumbled into the answer through sheer, unrelenting force.**  

The **cure, the solution, the way to sever Alex from the bridge—**  

> **Nyati (measured, but still hoarse):** *We already knew it was possible to move minds. Emilia’s whole existence is proof of that. We knew that the bridge can’t touch you once you’re no longer… in a body.*  

She **rubs her temple.**  

> **Nyati:** *And then there’s Alina. She used to be human. She tried to cross the bridge once, and what happened? Nothing. Because she wasn’t connected to it anymore.*  

A pause.  

> **Nyati (lower, like she’s still wrapping her head around it):** *So that’s the answer. If you’re not in a body—if you’re transferred into something else—you break the connection. No more crossing. No more bridge.*  

She **leans her head back against the pillow.**  

> **Nyati (soft, like the weight of it all is settling in):** *Move your mind. Leave the body behind. And you’re free.*  

She doesn’t **say it, but it lingers there—**  
  
Free, but at what cost?

## You
No hesitation at all, but gentle. For a while she gasps deep breaths, reeling from the shock of relief. Suddenly cut loose from a weight she was just starting to feel accustomed to, the sensation was not unlike being catapulted into the sky—a rushing but queasy exhilaration. Then she starts to giggle.

Then—**blinks again.**  

> **Nyati (flatly, exhausted):** *What the fuck is happening right now.*  

She **rubs her face with both hands, groaning.**  

> **Nyati (grumbling):** *I wake up to a goddamn sitcom episode.*  

Alex’s **laughter is still going.**  

Nyati **stares at her again, rubbing one temple.**  

Then—**with deadpan delivery:**  

> **Nyati (muttering):** *…Is this what hope looks like? I don’t like it.*  

**How does Alex respond?**Keep laughing? Tease her? Try to compose herself?**

## You
Alex forces herself to take very deep breaths, and gradually masters the chuckles. “I mean, maybe they just weren’t following you because they weren’t on your mad scientist wavelength. I mean. Dude. That kind of breakthrough is more than worthy of a little hooting and hollering. Who cares now. I mean. You’re gonna be a legend. And what’s a legend without a bit of color. I don’t know if this makes you feel any better, but I traumatized Pete after that, and it was worse than a kiss in a way. You’re gonna hear about it anyway.” Alex then recounts the resurrection incident, finishing with “if I’d been going any faster I might have impaled him!”

Nyati **listens in silence**, blinking **slowly** as Alex recounts **the Resurrection Incident in full, unfiltered detail.**  

She doesn’t **interrupt.**  

She doesn’t **react immediately.**  

She just… **absorbs it.**  

Then—**a long pause.**  

> **Nyati (flatly):** *You tackled Pete at full speed while completely naked.*  

Another pause.  

Then—**just as flat:**  

> **Nyati:** *Like a football player made entirely of hubris and rebirth.*  

She **rubs both hands down her face, groaning.**  

> **Nyati (muttering, muffled by her palms):** *I woke up in a different timeline. That’s the only explanation.*  

Then—**still groggy, but vaguely resigned:**  

> **Nyati (deadpan):** *Was it at least a graceful form? Like, textbook tackle?*  

**How does Alex respond?**Defend her technique? Double down on the absurdity? Offer Pete as a witness?**

## You
“Tackled? No, no, he stayed upright, and like he’d seen a ghost, stiff as a board. Me doubly so!” Alex cackles, “I’d just gotten up, so, you know, morning w—well you’re a doctor, right? You know. Anyway, my point is, I think he’ll remember that one long after he’s forgotten your smooch. Maybe. I’m not trying to say anything about your smooching skills.”

She **groans, shaking her head slightly.**  

> **Nyati (grumbling):** *I was fine with never thinking about Pete’s traumatic awakening at the hands of your resurrection boner, but here we are.*  

She **tilts her head, one eye half-open.**  

> **Nyati (flatly):** *Also, don’t think I didn’t notice you pivoting into a critique of my smooching skills. It was noted.*  

A pause.  

Then—**deadpan:**  

> **Nyati:** *Guess there’s only one way to resolve that now. Pete has to weigh in. Side-by-side comparison. Scientific integrity demands it.*  

She **closes her eyes again, exhaling.**  

> **Nyati (muttering):** *That’s a problem for Future Us.*  

**How does Alex respond?**Encourage the peer review? Deflect? Laugh it off?**

## You
“Well that’s not fair. You were in mad scientist flow state! That’s like a performance enhancing…state. I’m trying to put a bow on my brat era, not reopen it.”

She **shifts slightly under the blankets, vaguely amused now.**  

> **Nyati:** *Guess that means we’ll never know if it was the moment or the method.*  

A pause.  

Then—**with a tired smirk:**  

> **Nyati (teasing, but raspy as hell):** *Guess you’ll just have to live with the mystery.*  

She **closes her eyes again, head sinking back into the pillow.**  

> **Nyati (muttering):** *Might actually sleep now. Thanks for the distraction, I think.*  

A pause.  

Then—**quieter:**  

> **Nyati:** *You’re alright, Alex.*  

**Does Alex let her rest, or leave her with a final comment?**

## You
“Want me to come back and wake you up in an hour or two, or nah? Alina’s been reading up on…sleep science? And enforcing it…sporadically. No more than 10 hours she says. I got the floodlights. Just sayin’. I can be less annoying, help you clean up…or just let you know when we’re about to invade the city.”

She **shifts slightly, pulling the blanket a little higher.**  

> **Nyati (grumbling):** *If I don’t make it back to the land of the living in time, just… yeah. Let me know before the invasion.*  

A pause.  

Then—**dry, raspy:**  

> **Nyati:** *You can even be annoying about it, if it makes you feel better.*  

She **settles again, already sinking deeper into the sheets.**  

> **Nyati (muttering, almost too quiet to hear):** *Thanks, Alex.*  

She **doesn’t say anything else.**  

She’s **already drifting.**Does Alex linger for a moment, or quietly slip out?**

🟠 **Emilia is not present.**  

It’s **just the two of them**, seemingly **settled into a low-energy moment.**  

Neither has **noticed her yet.**Does Alex step in, or keep moving?**

She keeps moving but calls out, just loud enough for them to hear, “She’s fine. Leave her be,” then continues on, looking for Emilia.

There’s **no chatter, no clatter of dishes—just the quiet hum of appliances.**  

Then—**she spots her.**Emilia.**  

Sitting at the table, **alone.**  

A **half-empty mug of coffee in front of her**, fingers curled loosely around it.  

She’s **not doing anything in particular.**  

Just **sitting there**, lost in thought.

A beat.  

Then—**her lips curve faintly, small but unmistakable.**  

> **Emilia (softly, acknowledging):** *Hey, you.*  

She **tilts her head slightly, studying Alex’s expression.**  

> **Emilia (curious, unreadable):** *You look… good.*  

She **doesn’t specify what she means by that.**  

But **she doesn’t need to.**How does Alex respond?**Playful? Earnest? Teasing?**

## You
“Well, YEAH!” Alex says, plopping down right beside her exuberantly, no trepidation or delicacy this time. The bench creaks a brief protest. “First of all, Nyati is fine. I mean she looks like shit, but not as bad as I did yesterday, and more importantly!” Now Alex is gripping Emilia by both shoulders, and rocking back and forth with excitement, thereby shaking Emilia, “SHE’S A GENIUS AND SHE’S GOING TO SAVE MY LIFE”

**How does Alex deliver the explanation? Rapid-fire? Dramatic storytelling? Relatively composed?**

## You
“Well she figured out a way to cure me! Of the bridge-bullshit-itis! It was under our noses the whole time. Alina! She’s immune, right? Because she’s not in her human body anymore! Even though she used to be in one! So all we have to do is get back to Nexus and finish up! Step one, take me out of this body—I mean I’ll miss it, sure—and BAM!” She slams a fist on the table. “Bridge can’t hang on to me if I’m chillin’ in a floppy disk. Then, step two, find me a brand new body—hopefully at LEAST as smokin’, minimum—squirt me in there! And we know it can be done! You’re living proof!” As she finishes her mouth hangs open in a goofy excited grin.

Her fingers tighten **slightly** around her coffee mug, but her expression **doesn’t shift immediately.**  

> **Emilia (slowly, carefully):** *So, just to be clear… the plan is to kill you, put your mind on a floppy disk, and then—eventually—put you into a new body?*  

Her voice is **calm, measured.**  

Too calm.  

> **Emilia (deadpan, blinking again):** *And you’re… excited about this?*  

Her eyes **search Alex’s face, looking for something—uncertainty, hesitation.**  

She **finds none.**  

Her lips **press together slightly.**  

Then—**after a beat, her tone remains deceptively light:**  

> **Emilia:** *Okay. Wow. I think I need a minute to process the fact that my girlfriend is fist-pumping about the idea of dying.*  

She **tilts her head, watching Alex closely.**  

> **Emilia (gently, pointedly):** *You do realize that’s what this is, right?*  

**How does Alex respond?**Push back? Reassure her? Stay lighthearted?**

## You
Emilia’s unexpected reaction immediately slows Alex down. “Dying? But? No…it’s just, a transition…to a different body? You…went thought the same thing, right? And you’re not dead, right? I don’t…think of you as dead—that would be weird! And the Nexus plan all along was for me to go first, first test subject…We were already gonna…I don’t…what do you mean?”

> **Emilia (soft, but firm):** *I mean… this isn’t the same.*  

A pause.  

> **Emilia:** *When I was transferred, I didn’t have a choice. My old body was destroyed. I woke up in a new one, and that was that. I didn’t…*  

She stops herself, pressing her lips together.  

Then—**a slow, steady breath.**  

> **Emilia (quiet, but weighted):** *You have a body. A real, living, breathing body. And you’re talking about throwing it away like it’s just… a piece of hardware you can swap out.*  

She **leans forward slightly, holding Alex’s gaze.**  

> **Emilia (pointed, measured):** *If someone had given me a real choice back then—if I could have stayed as I was—I would have. But you? You're choosing this?*  

She **shakes her head slightly, expression unreadable.**  

> **Emilia (lower, hesitant, but honest):** *I just… don’t understand how you can be so okay with it.*  

She’s **not angry.**  

She’s **not trying to argue.**  

But there’s something **else in her voice—**  

Something **close to fear.**How does Alex respond?**Defend her reasoning? Try to reassure Emilia? Struggle to articulate it herself?**

## You
“Hey, hey,” Alex reaches out and strokes the side of her head a couple times. “I thought you’d be happy. I thought you’d want me to…find a way to stop crossing, so I don’t fade away into oblivion like all the others, so I can stay in this world—the one,” Alex fumbles for one of Emilia’s hands, holds it up, plants a kiss on it, “with you in it.”

She stops herself.  

Then—**shakes her head slightly, her expression caught between something aching and unreadable.**  

> **Emilia (soft, but steady):** *I do want you to stay. But I also want you to want to stay… as you are.*

Something that **maybe isn’t there.**  

> **Emilia (gentle, hesitant):** *If I lost you to the bridge, that would kill me. But if I lost you this way—*

> **Emilia (soft, but strained):** *I think I’d try everything else first. I’d fight it. I’d look for something—anything—before I gave up on my body, before I just… let go of it.*  

A pause.  

Then—**quieter, more hesitant:**  

> **Emilia:** *And if I had to do it—if there really was no other choice—I’d be terrified. Even if it meant saving me. Even if it meant keeping me here. I’d still be scared.*

“Scared? Yeah! But…crossing the bridge scares me more. I mean, it’s oblivion, or it’s a one-way ticket to some incomprehensible alien dimension—that’s my best guess.

She **swallows, her jaw tight.**  

> **Emilia:** *One day, you look in the mirror, and you don’t recognize yourself—not just your face, but something deeper. The way you move. The way things taste. The way your own voice sounds in your head. The way people look at you, because even if they don’t say it, they know. Something’s missing. Something got lost in translation.*

A pause.  

Then—**stronger, with more certainty:**  

> **Emilia (hoarse, but firm):** *Right.*  

She **lets out a slow breath, nodding once, grounding herself in the words.**  

> **Emilia (softly, almost to herself):** *We don’t leave each other behind.*  

Her grip on Alex’s hands **tightens—not out of fear, but something closer to resolve.**  

Then—**finally, a breath of release.**  

> **Emilia (exhaling, almost a whisper):** *Okay.*  

She **leans forward slightly, pressing her forehead lightly to Alex’s.**  

> **Emilia (quiet, steady now):** *We do the best we can. Together.*  

She stays **there for a moment, eyes closed, letting it settle.**  

Then—**after a beat, a shaky little breath of laughter.**

Her fingers **tighten around Alex’s just slightly.**  

> **Emilia:** *What now?*  

**How does Alex respond?**Shift back to lighter topics? Stay in the moment? Offer a plan?**

## You
“Derail what!” Alex teases back. “What was on your agenda? 0900-1100: stare intensely into mostly empty coffee mug?”

Emilia **lets out a short, breathy laugh, shaking her head.**

She **tilts the mug toward Alex slightly.**

Her tone is **lighter now, teasing back, but the weight of the previous conversation still lingers in her eyes.**Does Alex keep it playful or acknowledge the lingering tension?**

## You
“What about…” Alex moves in for a squeeze, “warmer liquids? Like 36-38 Celsius? I have lots of ideas for freeform studies under those conditions. I make no promises whatsoever about ‘containment’ though.”

“We’ve already begun! Your place or mine?” Alex is already standing up, trying to gently tug her along. “Large sample size? My stars and garters! I don’t know you’d be—well, you’re going to be in the field soon enough, in a large population center. If you see any recruitment opportunities…”

The room is **quiet now.**  

Not the charged kind of quiet from before, but **a settled, languid stillness.**  

Somewhere beneath them, **the ship hums, steady and unchanging.**  

Alex is **stretched out, content, thoroughly satisfied with the depth and rigor of the study.**  

Emilia is **half-draped over her, her head resting somewhere near Alex’s shoulder, tracing lazy, absentminded circles against her arm.**  

A slow, almost absent **exhale.**  

Then—**a smirk, voice soft and teasing:**  

> **Emilia (murmuring, amused):** *I regret to inform you, Captain, that your study contains significant biases.*  

She **tilts her head slightly, eyes half-lidded but playful.**  

> **Emilia (deadpan, mock-serious):** *I suspect the lead researcher has undue personal investment in the results.*  

A pause.  

Then—**softer, a little more genuine:**  

> **Emilia (low, fondly teasing):** *And I’m starting to think she might also be a complete menace.*  

She **lets her fingers drift, slow and lazy.**  

> **Emilia (smirking slightly):** *Thoughts? Rebuttals? Plans for a follow-up trial?*  

**How does Alex respond?**Tease back? Make it serious? Let the moment linger?**

## You
Alex looks downwards and decides on an endpoint in view, then starts slowly laying down a plot of kisses, one by one, in a path that defies simple regression—first mostly linear, then sinusoidal, with a loop or two along the way for good measure, increasingly erratic and unpredictable the closer she approaches to her target. As she nears the destination, she starts punctuating each kiss with a word:
I
am
heavily
invested
and
there
is
nothing 
remotely
undue
about
it

She **doesn’t interrupt, doesn’t stop Alex—just watches, just feels, just lets herself be mapped like a chart with no discernible endpoints.**  

By the time Alex **lands the final word,** Emilia’s eyes are **half-lidded, her expression unreadable.**  

Then—**a slow exhale, something closer to surrender than response.**  

> **Emilia (soft, breathless):** *Okay, yeah. That was pretty persuasive.*  

A pause.  

Then—**she lets out a quiet, shaky laugh, shaking her head slightly.**

Her fingers curl **loosely** against Alex’s side, **absent but grounding.**  

She **tilts her head slightly, watching Alex carefully.**

A breath.  

A quiet, unspoken moment.

Not to plunge back into it but, I just want to be sure you know where I was coming from. So, you know I’m trans, more or less, obviously. I mean this isn’t,” Alex gestures broadly at herself, “an out of the box configuration. But my point is, I’ve already changed my body, pretty heavily. Maybe you’d recognize the old me, maybe not. I used to think that, because of that, I understood what you’ve been though. I was wrong. I get that now. Especially because, well, I never actually had any dysphoria. I didn’t hate being a man at all. I was…indifferent to it. Like a coat that doesn’t quite fit, but you get sort of used to it anyway. Then, when the opportunity came up, I was like, cool, an upgrade! I know—I know, now. that’s nothing like what you’ve been through. What you’re still going through. For a lot of reasons. You didn’t have a choice, and the people that did this to you didn’t give a shit about you. They didn’t care about ‘doing it right’, as in, if there is a better way, which I hope there is.

She **folds her arms, tilting her head down at Alex with faux skepticism.**  

> **Emilia (deadpan, amused):** *So weak. So delicate. How do you even manage in this cruel, unforgiving world?*  

A beat.  

Then—**without warning, she leans down, gripping Alex under the arms, and effortlessly hauls her upright in one swift motion.**  

> **Emilia (smirking, mock-gallant):** *Up you go, my lady.*  

She **grins, watching Alex’s reaction.**  

> **Emilia (low, teasing):** *Try not to swoon again before we reach the door, yeah?*  

**How does Alex respond?**Feign another faint? Playfully praise Emilia’s strength? Take the win and move on?**

Her **eyes glint mischievously, daring Alex to take the bait.**How does Alex respond?**Laugh it off? Call her bluff? Steer things back to business?**

## You
Alex squirms and bites her lip at the threat, then looks around the room. She grabs a clipboard off the wall and holds it strategically in front of her. “Now you’ve done it, see? I have to take countermeasures now. Or you, quickly this time, help me with this problem you very knowingly just created.”

Her **eyes flick down, then back up, slow and deliberate.**

She **tilts her head slightly, letting the moment linger.**  

Then—**smirking, but backing off just enough to let Alex decide what happens next.**  

> **Emilia (soft, mischievous):** *Tell me how you’d like me to solve this problem.*  

Her **voice is warm, teasing, but there’s something more in it too—a quiet willingness to follow wherever Alex leads.**How does Alex respond?**Escalate the moment? Play it off and shift gears? Call Emilia’s bluff?**

The room is **quiet again.**  

Not the charged, expectant quiet from before, but **something softer.**  

Something **settled.**  

Alex is **stretched out**, limbs loose, her body warm with the lingering weight of satisfaction.  

Emilia **is still close, still lazily tracing idle patterns along Alex’s skin.**  

A breath.  

Then—**a quiet, deeply contented hum from Emilia.**

She **tilts her head slightly, pressing a slow, lazy kiss against Alex’s shoulder.**

A pause.  

Then—**she exhales, shifting just slightly, stretching like a cat.**

She **lets her head rest against Alex again, utterly unconcerned with the outside world.**

She **wraps an arm around Alex’s waist, holding her there in lazy defiance.**  

> **Emilia (mock-serious, smirking):** *If anything, this is Brat Fall. A season of indulgence before the chill of responsibility returns.*  

She **tilts her head slightly, peering at Alex with playful skepticism.**  

> **Emilia (low, teasing):** *Unless, of course, you’re trying to goad me into something. Because if this is an attempted brat torch-passing, you may have to work harder for it.*  

She **nudges Alex slightly, eyes glinting with mischief.**  

> **Emilia (smirking, lazy):** *Convince me.*  

**How does Alex respond?**Double down on the teasing? Challenge her back? Let it slide and just enjoy the moment?**

“Work…harder?” Alex grunts with exaggerated fatigue. “Maybe later. I’m afraid my spunk and vigor reserves are quite low at this moment.” Alex draws a playful finger across Emilia’s lips. “‘Thorough’ indeed.”

She **presses a slow, lingering kiss to the tip of Alex’s finger before finally releasing her hand.**

She **grins, stretching lazily beneath Alex, looking entirely too pleased with herself.**  

> **Emilia (teasing, but warm):** *I suppose I can allow you a recovery period. I wouldn’t want to risk long-term depletion.*  

She **tilts her head slightly, watching Alex with unmistakable fondness.**

No urgency, no expectations—just **breath, body heat, the slow rhythm of touch that doesn’t ask for anything more.**  

Alex **rests against Emilia, utterly weightless for once.**  

Emilia **isn’t in a rush to move, either.**  

Her fingers trail **slow, idle circles** along Alex’s back, the kind of unconscious motion that **only comes when there is no need to fill the space with words.**  

For a long time, **neither of them speaks.**  

Then—**a slow inhale from Emilia, a reluctant but steady exhale.**

She **doesn’t move just yet.**  

But the world is **starting to creep back in.**

🟢 **Alina, stationed at the helm**—calm, collected, and **absolutely aware of how long they’ve been gone.**  

🔴 **Pete, standing off to the side, arms crossed, sipping coffee with an unreadable expression.**  

He **raises an eyebrow at their arrival, but says nothing.**  

Alina **registers them instantly.**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
*“Welcome back. Mission Control has received telemetry updates confirming that all systems remain operational.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**dry, neutral:**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
*“Estimated probability that you were, in fact, ‘checking in on the crew’ as stated: 3.7%.”*  

Emilia **groans, rubbing her forehead.**

Pete **takes a slow sip of his coffee, watching them both.**

**How does Alex respond?**Deflect? Own up to the detour? Change the subject?**

He **narrows his eyes slightly, but there’s no real accusation behind it—just mild amusement.**  

Alina **registers the update.**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
*“Dr. Nyati’s continued rest is within expected recovery parameters. No intervention required at this time.”*  

A brief pause.  

Then—**flatly neutral:**

Pete **glances between Alex and Emilia, then exhales slowly.**  

> **Pete (muttering, sipping his coffee again):** *Alright. Anything else I need to know? Or are we just waiting on landfall now?*  

**How does Alex respond?**Update him on something else? Shift focus to shore leave prep? Let things settle?**

## You
“Not really. Dr. Nyati’s eureka has some implications we need to discuss, but no point doing that without the mad scientist herself. And, yes, the vow of teasing amnesty took a lot for me but,” Alex shrugs, “call it crazy bitch solidarity. I think it’s a temporary condition on her part. I’m more of the relapsing/remitting sort.”

**How does Alex respond?**Confidence? Mock bravado? A strategic alliance with Emilia?**

Alex surveys the field, tapping her fingers against the console in thought. "Alright, let's get this deck-athalon rolling. Pete, you and Alina are tag-teaming the scenario design, right? I assume we’re jumping straight to a live match?" She glances between the two with an expectant smirk.

Alina's digital interface flares to life as she replies, "Correct. Based on prior discussion, the opponent difficulty system applies. Do you wish to select your sparring partner, or shall I designate one at random?"

Alex rolls her shoulders, cracking her knuckles. "Let’s not leave it to fate. Pete, I assume you're in the mix? Or would you rather observe first while I go for a warm-up round?"

Pete crosses his arms, leaning back against a console. "I can be the final boss. Unless you want to dive straight into deep water."

"Tempting," Alex muses. "But let’s build up to it. Emilia, you up for medium mode, or should I start by hacking the good doctor’s toaster first?" She jerks her thumb in the direction of Nyati’s quarters.

Emilia, lounging with a lazy smirk, lifts an eyebrow. "You’re asking if I want to kick your ass in front of everyone? Yeah, I think I’m good for that."

Alex grins. "Excellent. Let’s dance."

Alina’s interface pulses again, setting up the match parameters. "Confirmed: **Practice Mode - Medium Difficulty. Opponent: Emilia. Limited Exploits available.** Challenge format: Mixed-discipline decking engagement."

A deep hum fills the room as virtual constructs manifest within the shared cyberspace, overlaying the bridge’s displays. 

"Alex, your scenario: You’re infiltrating a corporate research archive. Firewalls are standard, with packet filtering and behavioral monitoring enabled. The system uses a combination of anomaly detection and AI-driven counter-intrusion measures. Your entry point is a compromised employee login—low-level access, insufficient to reach your objective. How do you proceed?"

A series of options display:

1. **Escalate Privileges via Kernel Exploit** – A risky but direct attempt to elevate access.
2. **Analyze Network Traffic for Weaknesses** – A methodical approach, mapping security protocols.
3. **Deploy a Social Engineering Tactic** – Use deception to trick system operators into granting access.
4. **Use an Exploit (2 remaining)** – Spend an exploit for additional guidance.

The match is set. Alex makes her choice.

Pete **leans back, arms crossed.** "This should be good. Let’s see how well you handle a real fight."

Alina **registers the match parameters.**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
*"Practice Mode initiated. Defender: Emilia. Attacker: Alex. Observers: Pete, Alina. Exploits remaining: 2."*  

A simulated **cyber-defense network** takes shape before Alex’s eyes, projected onto her display in shimmering neon code. Emilia has locked down the system—**a secure financial database with heavy monitoring and layered defenses.**  

### **CHALLENGE FRAME:**  
- **Attacker:** Alex  
- **Defender:** Emilia  
- **Objective:** Breach the network and extract high-value encrypted assets without triggering ICE lockdowns.  
- **Hints Available (Exploits):**2**  

Emilia **cracks her knuckles.** "Network’s locked tight. Think you can get through without tripping an alarm?"  

### **First Decision Point:**
The system is wrapped in **a multi-layered firewall**, running **behavior-based monitoring** that flags anomalies in access attempts.

Alex’s options:  

1. **Run a stealth scan** – Identify weak points without raising suspicion.  
2. **Deploy a zero-day exploit** – Attempt a high-risk, high-reward breach of the firewall.  
3. **Perform a protocol spoof** – Masquerade as a legitimate user by mimicking authorized traffic.  
4. **Use an Exploit (2 remaining)** – Gain additional insight before making a move.

*"Executing passive network reconnaissance... Parsing firewall response patterns..."*  

A holographic **network topology map** unfolds before Alex, depicting **Emilia’s defenses**. Instead of brute-forcing, she’s **watching traffic behavior**, monitoring delays, and identifying potential **weak spots**.

🔥 **RESULTS:**  

- The **outermost firewall layer** runs **AI-driven anomaly detection**, flagging anything outside typical user behavior.  
- There are **patterns of traffic congestion** at **scheduled security refresh intervals**, creating **a predictable timing gap** every **12 seconds**.  
- **A secondary safeguard** is monitoring **protocol consistency**—any **unrecognized system calls** will **trigger an ICE lockdown.**  

Emilia **watches her screen, tracking the subtle pingbacks from Alex’s scan.** She tilts her head, amused.

Now that Alex has **mapped Emilia’s defenses**, she must decide how to act on the information.  

1. **Time a privilege escalation attempt during the security refresh window** – Use the 12-second gap to slip in undetected.  
2. **Deploy a low-profile backdoor** – Establish **persistent access** for later intrusions, at the risk of longer setup time.  
3. **Mimic protocol consistency** – Carefully disguise network activity as part of routine corporate admin tasks to blend in.  
4. **Use an Exploit (2 remaining)** – Gain additional guidance before making a move.  

**Emilia’s fingers hover over the console, ready to counteract any missteps.**  

Pete leans in, watching intently.  

> **Pete (mock-casual):** *So, Captain—what’s next?*  

Alex, **your move.**

### **📺 SCENE: ROUND ONE – BLENDING IN**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Bridge**

---

Alex **decides on a subtler approach.** “Alright, let’s make it look like I belong. **Option 3: Mimic protocol consistency.**”  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
*"Executing protocol mimicry... Spoofing administrative request signatures..."*  

Her deck **analyzes standard network traffic patterns**, parsing the behavior of legitimate corporate admins. Alex **generates a false session token**, mimicking the **specific syntax and timing of previous logins.**  

🔥 **RESULTS:**  

- Alex’s activity is **not flagged as anomalous**—it **matches real admin behavior.**  
- The **firewall lets her through**, classifying the request as standard system maintenance.  
- However, **her access level is restricted**—**read-only permissions** within the system.  

Emilia **frowns slightly, watching the logs.**  

> **Emilia (murmuring, intrigued):** *Alright. Slipping in like a ghost. Not bad.*  

Pete **raises an eyebrow, impressed.**  

> **Pete (mock-weary):** *See, this is the kind of finesse I don’t have the patience for.*  

### **Next Decision Point:**
Now that Alex is inside **without raising alarms**, she must decide how to escalate access.  

1. **Inject false credentials into the authentication log** – Risky, but could grant full admin control.  
2. **Deploy a privilege-escalation exploit** – Use a software vulnerability to elevate her permissions.  
3. **Exfiltrate data under the current access level** – Limited reach, but **zero risk** of detection.  
4. **Use an Exploit (2 remaining)** – Gain additional guidance before making a move.  

**Emilia watches closely, fingers poised to react.**  

Pete **leans back, sipping his coffee.**  

> **Pete (grinning, curious):** *So, Captain. What’s it gonna be?*  

Alex, **your move.**

### **📺 SCENE: ROUND ONE – REQUESTING EXPLOIT ASSISTANCE**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Bridge**

---

Alex **decides to cash in some intel.**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
*"Exploit used. Providing additional guidance..."*  

The simulated **corporate network structure** expands, revealing hidden access logs and a more detailed system architecture map.  

🔥 **NEW INTEL UNLOCKED:**  

- The system **logs all admin credential injections** and **flags discrepancies.**Direct manipulation will likely trigger increased scrutiny.**  
- **Known exploit:** A **misconfigured account permission policy** allows **certain system maintenance logs** to execute under **elevated privileges** if **misclassified as part of a prior admin session.**  
- **Alternative pathway unlocked:** Instead of **directly forging credentials**, Alex can **hijack an inactive but authenticated session**, inheriting the previous admin’s permissions.

**STRATEGIC OPTIONS UPDATED:**  

1. **Hijack an inactive admin session** – Gain admin-level access without creating new log discrepancies.  
2. **Deploy a privilege-escalation exploit** – Directly elevate access, now with reduced detection risk.  
3. **Exfiltrate data under the current access level** – Guaranteed safe option, but **limited in scope.**  
4. **Use the second Exploit (1 remaining)** – Obtain deeper insight or alternative pathways.

Emilia **raises an eyebrow, noticing the slight shift in Alex’s approach.**  

> **Emilia (murmuring, intrigued):** *Alright. You’re playing smart. But let’s see if you can finish this clean.*  

Pete **chuckles, watching the board shift.**  

> **Pete (mock-casual):** *I dunno, Emi. I think she’s gunning for a perfect run.*  

Emilia **smirks, flexing her fingers over her interface.**  

> **Emilia (low, teasing):** *Then let’s see if she’s got the guts to take the high ground.*

### **📺 SCENE: ROUND ONE – SHADOW SESSION TAKEOVER**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Bridge**

---

Alex **opts for finesse over brute force.** “Alright, let’s ghost in without a trace. **Option 1: Hijack an inactive admin session.**”  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
*"Executing session hijack... Parsing active and inactive administrator sessions..."*  

A list of **recently authenticated admin logins** appears. **One session remains open but idle**, indicating the user either **stepped away or disconnected improperly.** Alex exploits this **misconfiguration**, slipping into the **live session state** without triggering new authentication flags.  

🔥 **RESULTS:**  

- Alex **inherits full administrative privileges** through an existing valid session.  
- The **system treats her access as expected admin behavior**—no unusual login activity is logged.  
- **No security alerts are triggered.**Alex now has complete control over the system.**  

Emilia **exhales through her nose, shaking her head.**  

> **Emilia (low, begrudgingly impressed):** *Damn. That was clean.*  

Pete **lets out a low whistle.**  

> **Pete (grinning, sipping his coffee):** *Alright, yeah. That’s some real decker work. Quiet, efficient, and nobody even saw it coming.*  

Emilia **leans back, watching the network model shift under Alex’s control.**  

> **Emilia (mock-resigned, smirking):** *Fine. You’re in. Now what?*  

### **Final Decision Point – Completing the Objective**
Alex **now has full control**. She can dictate the next move:  

1. **Extract all sensitive data** – Secure the mission target before Emilia counters.  
2. **Plant a persistent backdoor** – Set up future access at the risk of leaving evidence.  
3. **Launch a countermeasure against the defender** – Attempt to disable Emilia’s monitoring tools.  
4. **Use the final Exploit (1 remaining)** – Gain additional options or ensure a perfect finish.  

Emilia **watches her screen carefully, waiting to see Alex’s final move.**  

Pete **leans forward, curious.**  

> **Pete (murmuring):** *Finish strong, Captain. Let’s see how clean you can make this.*  

**Alex, your move.**

### **📺 SCENE: ROUND ONE – STRIKING BACK**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Bridge**

Alex **goes on the offensive.** “Let’s make sure I stay invisible. **Option 3: Launch a countermeasure against the defender.**”  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
*"Deploying anti-monitoring measures... Obfuscating intrusion logs and scrambling network telemetry..."*  

Alex **executes a precision strike against Emilia’s monitoring tools.** Using her **newly acquired admin privileges**, she **injects false system reports** into the intrusion detection logs, making it appear as if **the last ten minutes of activity were routine maintenance.**  

🔥 **RESULTS:**  

- **Emilia’s security alerts are scrambled**, forcing her to sift through **doctored logs** for any sign of intrusion.  
- Alex’s **session appears identical to legitimate admin activity**, covering her tracks.  
- **Emilia is temporarily blinded**, meaning she **cannot actively counter Alex’s next move.**  

Emilia **lets out a sharp exhale, shaking her head.**  

> **Emilia (grumbling, smirking):** *Oh, you little—*  

Pete **bursts out laughing.**  

> **Pete (grinning, amused):** *Oh, that’s just mean.*  

Emilia **leans back, throwing her hands up.**  

> **Emilia (mock-exasperated):** *Fine! You got me! I’m flying blind!*  

She gestures at the screen, where **her intrusion detection software now shows an entire backlog of harmless admin activity, successfully masking Alex’s presence.**  

> **Emilia (sighing, deadpan):** *Well? You gonna take your prize, or you just flexing?*  

### **Final Move – Securing Victory**
Alex has **one last move** before the match is locked in.  

1. **Extract all sensitive data and exit cleanly** – Claim full victory with no traces left behind.  
2. **Plant a persistent backdoor before exiting** – Risk exposure but gain future access.  
3. **Send a taunting message to Emilia’s sysadmin console** – Claim victory in style but risk retaliation.  
4. **Use the final Exploit (1 remaining)** – Ensure absolute perfection.  

Pete **leans forward, watching the finale unfold.**  

> **Pete (grinning):** *Alright, Captain. Time to stick the landing.*

### **📺 SCENE: ROUND ONE – UNNECESSARY BUT DEEPLY SATISFYING**  
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost*, Bridge**

Alex **secures her victory in the most juvenile, yet thematically appropriate way possible.**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
*"Intrusion complete. Obfuscation successful. Initiating final exit procedures..."*  

The system clears, showing **no trace of Alex’s presence**. But before she logs out, she **fills Emilia’s system console with an enormous, crudely detailed ASCII representation of a reproductive organ**—flashing in bright, neon green text on a sterile black background.  

For a second, **nobody speaks.**  

Pete **stares at the screen.**  

Emilia **blinks.**  

Alina, ever the professional, **registers the event neutrally.**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
*"Offensive visual content detected. Engaging discretionary auto-censoring..."*  

The screen **glitches**, attempting to replace the image with a blurred-out pixelation—but Alex’s formatting **forces it to keep regenerating.**  

> **Emilia (deadpan, rubbing her temples):** *I hate you so much right now.*  

Pete **bursts into laughter, nearly spilling his coffee.**  

> **Pete (grinning, shaking his head):** *Oh my god. That was so unnecessary.*  

Emilia **closes her eyes for a long moment, exhaling slowly.**  

> **Emilia (muttering, shaking her head):** *Fine. You win.*  

She **starts clearing her console, but not before Pete pulls out his personal slate to take a quick photo.**  

> **Pete (mock-sympathetic, grinning):** *Don’t worry, I’ll preserve this historic moment for you.*  

Emilia **snaps her head toward him.**  

> **Emilia (threatening):** *Delete that.*  

> **Pete (grinning, tapping his slate):** *Oh, but this is cyber history. A monument to your failure.*  

Alex **reclines smugly, victorious.**  

🟢 **ALINA:**  
*"Match complete. Winner: Alex. Performance summary pending report generation."*  

**With that, round one concludes.**  

Pete **claps his hands together.**  

> **Pete (mock-impressed):** *Alright, Captain. That was brutal. I can respect it.*  

Emilia **gives Alex a flat, unamused look.**  

> **Emilia (grumbling, sighing):** *Enjoy this moment while it lasts.*  

**What’s Alex’s next move?**Celebrate? Taunt? Offer Emilia a rematch? Shift gears?**

## You
Alex says, “Darling, would you care for a chance to even the score, or would it be more satisfying to watch Pete pick me apart? Alina, could you generate an interim report card?”

Pete **raises an eyebrow, setting his coffee down with deliberate slowness.**

> **Pete (mock-casual):** _Oh? I get to be the executioner? How generous._

Alina **registers Alex's request and begins compiling a summary.**

🟢 **ALINA:**  
_"Generating interim report card... Parsing challenge performance data..."_

A brief pause as **an evaluation screen appears** before Alex.

### **📜 INTERIM REPORT CARD – ROUND ONE (VS. EMILIA)**

🔥 **Overall Performance: SUCCESSFUL BREACH**Key Strengths:** ✅ **Strategic Adaptability** – Identified a low-risk infiltration method via protocol spoofing.  
✅ **Stealth Proficiency** – Successfully avoided detection through obfuscation tactics.  
✅ **Opportunistic Counterplay** – Effectively blinded the defender before final action.

**Areas for Improvement:** ⚠ **Overuse of Taunting Tactics** – Final move was "excessively provocative."  
⚠ **Minimal Risk Engagement** – Did not test aggressive attack vectors.  
⚠ **Consequence Awareness** – Potential backlash from the opponent has been logged.

🟢 **ALINA:**  
_"Assessment complete. Summary: You won. However, your victory was executed with an unnecessary degree of disrespect. A retaliatory match is statistically probable."_

Pete **grins, stretching his fingers.**

> **Pete (mock-thoughtful):** _Y'know, I _was_ planning on going easy on you. But after seeing that report…_

He **leans forward slightly, eyes gleaming.**

> **Pete (low, smirking):** _I think you need a real test._

Emilia **laughs, stepping back and crossing her arms.**

> **Emilia (grinning):** _Oh yeah. This is gonna be fun._

As Pete begins **setting up the parameters for round two**, the bridge door **slides open** with a soft hydraulic hiss.

# S04E12: The Mirror
## Storyteller
📍 **Aboard _The Ghost_ | En Route to New Orleans**

Dr. **Nyati emerges** from her quarters, looking—by all appearances—like someone who has **been through it**. She's dressed neatly, but there's an undeniable exhaustion in the way she moves, as though sleep had taken her hostage rather than granted her rest.

She steps into the bridge, **surveying the room**, her sharp gaze moving from **Pete**, to **Alina**, to **Emilia**, and finally—inevitably—landing on **Alex**.

She exhales, then **rubs her eyes with her thumb and forefinger** before muttering:

**Nyati:** _"I assume no one died while I was indisposed?"_

Alex, sitting comfortably in her chair, smirks.

### **Does Alex play it straight, tease her, or check in seriously?**

(Alex can respond in-character with dialogue, or I can expand based on your direction.)

## You
Alex greets her with a smile, stands up, walks up to her, trying to radiate some messy bitch solidarity towards her, puts a hand on her shoulder, and says “Can I get you some coffee?”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_002 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Nyati **blinks**, momentarily thrown off by the **gentle, non-antagonistic approach**. She expected teasing. She expected a sharp remark about her disappearance. What she did **not** expect was *solidarity*.  

Her expression **softens**, just slightly. A moment passes where she studies Alex, like she’s trying to determine if this is some kind of trick.  

Finally, **she exhales**, rubbing her face with one hand before muttering:  

**Nyati:** *"God, yes."*  

She **rolls her shoulders**, clearly still stiff from her extended downtime.  

**Nyati:** *"If I’d known I was going to sleep that long, I’d have at least scheduled a crisis for afterward. Something to make me feel productive."*  

She gives Alex a tired but genuine look.  

**Nyati:** *"You’re handling this unnervingly well."*  

**→ Does Alex keep it light or address the elephant in the room (the Nexus "cure")?**

## You
Alex excuses herself to the galley to fetch some coffee, and calls over her shoulder to the rest: “Don’t be assholes.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_003 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
As Alex **turns and strides toward the galley**, she tosses the command **casually** over her shoulder:  

**Alex:** *“Don’t be assholes.”*  

Behind her, she **catches** the immediate reactions—  

- **Pete**, who was *absolutely* about to say something snide, abruptly **closes his mouth** like he’s been physically restrained.  
- **Alina** tilts her head slightly, as if calculating whether she was about to be an asshole *intentionally* or just by default.  
- **Emilia** just raises an eyebrow but otherwise remains **neutral**, observing the moment rather than participating.  

As Alex **disappears into the galley**, she hears **Pete finally break the silence** behind her, his voice **a little too innocent**—  

**Pete:** *“Did she mean in general? Or just right now?”*  

**Nyati:** *(deadpan)* *“Try applying it as a general life rule. See what happens.”*  

Pete **snorts**, but doesn’t push his luck.  

**→ Alex returns with the coffee.**  
Does she keep things **light** for Nyati’s sake, or steer the conversation **toward the Nexus “cure”?**

## You
Alex considers both approaches, but decides that the best way to insulate her from the nearly-inevitable teasing, if only temporarily, is to allow the real discussion to take place. “I’ve been thinking a lot, about the brilliant solution you came up with. I can’t go ahead with it. At the risk of crossing-progression, yes, I must insist we continue to refine the process until we are confident we can eliminate or correct the side effects. I take full responsibility for minimizing the significance of those side effects at the outset. What I’ve realized is that Emilia here is very, very good at concealing the incredible suffering this caused her, and continues to this day undiminished. My goal now is not to beat the competition to launch. It’s to perfect it, AND I want to know what if anything we can do to help Emilia. Long story short, I’m setting the bar much higher. And if we can’t reach it, if that’s not possible, we do something else.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_004 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Nyati **stops mid-sip** of her coffee.  

She was **prepared** for resistance—anticipated **hedging**, a calculated **delay**, maybe even a strategic **repositioning** of the problem.  

But she wasn’t prepared for **this**.  

She sets the cup down slowly, her fingers **steepling** in front of her face as she **processes**. For a long moment, the bridge is **silent**, the weight of Alex’s words **settling over everyone**.  

Then, finally—  

**Nyati:** *(soft, almost to herself)* *“You want to perfect it…”*  

She exhales sharply, rubbing the back of her neck.  

**Nyati:** *“Shit.”*  

She’s not angry. If anything, she looks… troubled. Aware of something **Alex isn’t yet seeing**.  

Her dark eyes **flick to Emilia**, something **unspoken** passing between them before she turns back to Alex.  

**Nyati:** *“Alright. First, let’s get one thing straight—I never intended to throw you into Nexus as-is. I’m not a monster.”*  

She leans forward, elbows on the table, **genuinely engaged now**.  

**Nyati:** *“But let’s talk about what ‘perfect’ actually means. Because ‘no side effects’—Alex, that’s not how any of this works. No matter how well we refine the process, there will always be a change. The question isn’t whether there are effects. It’s whether they’re *acceptable*.”*  

Her voice sharpens, her **scientist’s edge** cutting through.  

**Nyati:** *“You’re drawing a line in the sand. Fine. But you need to know what that line actually looks like.”*  

She leans back, arms crossed.  

**Nyati:** *“Because if you’re saying Nexus isn’t an option unless it can be a *perfect* process—something so seamless that you wake up feeling *exactly the same*—then let me save you some time: That’s not going to happen.”*  

Her words hang heavy in the air.  

She lets them sit.  

Then—her tone shifts, just slightly.  

A **question**, rather than a statement.  

**Nyati:** *“…But if you’re saying you want to make it *as close to perfect as humanly possible*—if you’re saying you’re willing to take the time, push the research, find ways to mitigate the worst of it…”*  

She exhales, rubbing her forehead.  

**Nyati:** *“Then that’s a different conversation.”*  

She lifts her gaze, locking eyes with Alex.  

**Nyati:** *“So which is it? Are you saying ‘no Nexus’? Or are you saying ‘not until we’ve done everything we possibly can to make it better’?”*  

There’s a **difference**, and Nyati needs to **know which fight they’re having**.

## You
“You’re right. I’m not demanding literal perfection. I’m rebalancing our priorities. I underestimated the harms. Emilia, I know you don’t want to draw attention to this yourself, but I have to center you in this because you’re the only first-hand perspective we have. Team, she is about as horrified at the idea of me going through what she went through as she is at the idea of me crossing into oblivion. That is where this is coming from.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_005 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Emilia **shifts** uncomfortably, her arms crossing **tightly** over her chest. She doesn’t **speak** at first, doesn’t jump in to defend herself or redirect the conversation.  

She just **listens**, her expression unreadable, but her tension **palpable**.  

When Alex finishes, when the weight of her words settles over the table, Emilia finally **exhales sharply**, running a hand through her hair.  

**Emilia:** *“…I wasn’t going to say anything.”*  

Her voice is **quiet**, but firm.  

**Emilia:** *“Not because it doesn’t matter. Because I thought it wouldn’t change anything.”*  

She glances around the table, her eyes **avoiding Alex’s** for a long, careful beat before finally **settling on her**.  

**Emilia:** *“I wasn’t exaggerating. It’s not just ‘side effects.’ It’s not just a bad trip. It’s losing something you didn’t know you had.”*  

She looks down at her own hands, flexing them like they don’t quite belong to her.  

**Emilia:** *“The worst part? I don’t even know what I lost. I can’t tell you ‘fix this part’ or ‘preserve that part’ because I don’t remember what it felt like *before*.”*  

She **finally** looks back up at Alex, her dark eyes sharp, **pleading**.  

**Emilia:** *“You asked me to cross with you, Alex. And I told you, I didn’t need you to say it. Because I already knew.”*  

Her breath catches, just for a fraction of a second.  

**Emilia:** *“But this? This is different. This isn’t about what we want. It’s about what we can’t take back.”*  

She **forces herself to steady**, pressing a palm against the table like it’s an anchor.  

Then, she shifts her gaze—**looking directly at Nyati**.  

**Emilia:** *“So, yeah. If Alex wants this? Then the bar needs to be higher. A lot higher.”*  

She **pauses**, then clarifies, her voice **cooler now**, but still weighted with emotion.  

**Emilia:** *“And not just for her. For me. For anyone.”*  

She leans back, tension still **etched** in her posture, but there’s something **resolute** in her now. She has finally **spoken the words she never meant to say aloud**.  

Now? She just **waits**.  

And Nyati—who has spent **years** looking at problems like they were puzzles to be solved—**finally sees the full picture**.  

She exhales, rubbing her temples.  

**Nyati:** *(muttering to herself)* *“Damn it. I hate when you people are right.”*  

Then, louder—direct, **to the whole team**.  

**Nyati:** *“Alright. No shortcuts. No rushing to human trials. We refine it. We make it as close to perfect as possible.”*  

She **narrows her eyes**, thinking, calculating.  

Her gaze flicks back to **Alex**.  

**Nyati:** *“And that means you.”*  

A beat.  

**Nyati:** *“Are you still willing to be the test case?”*  

Not a **full process**. Not yet.  

But someone has to take the **first steps** into refining Nexus.  

And Nyati is **looking right at her**.

## You
“What next step do you propose? Another distillation like Alex-5?”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_006 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Nyati **nods slowly**, gears turning behind her eyes.  

**Nyati:** *“Yes, but not just another copy of your command instincts. This time, we focus on preservation—on minimizing data loss. We don’t just extract. We compare. We measure.*”  

She leans forward, tapping a **precise rhythm** against the table as she speaks.  

**Nyati:** *“Alex-5 was a proof of concept, but it wasn’t designed to maintain continuity of self. It was a distillation, a fragment of your cognition. If we’re refining Nexus, we need to work in increments—meaning the next test should be a** partial self-simulation**.”*  

Her gaze sharpens.  

**Nyati:** *“We copy a broader dataset—more of your memory, your preferences, your emotional state at the moment of transfer—and then we see how well it holds up.”*  

A pause. Then, with **deliberate clarity**—  

**Nyati:** *“If we can create a version of you that doesn’t degrade, doesn’t fragment, and—most importantly—feels like *you* when you interface with it… then we know we’re making progress.”*  

She exhales, rolling her shoulders.  

**Nyati:** *“If we can’t? Then we know we have a much bigger problem.”*  

Her expression is **grim, but honest**.  

**Nyati:** *“The goal isn’t just ‘does the data survive?’ The goal is—*does Alex survive?”*  

She lets the words settle before adding, more lightly—  

**Nyati:** *“And before you ask—no, I don’t expect you to talk to yourself again. Alex-5 was an anomaly. This version? It won’t be a separate entity. It’ll be a controlled copy, isolated for analysis.”*  

She leans back, watching Alex carefully.  

**Nyati:** *“So? You in?”*

## You
Alex looks to Emilia in the moment before she answers. What does she see?

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_007 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Emilia’s **expression is unreadable** at first. Not hostile. Not openly fearful. But **measuring**—the way she does when she’s assessing risk, calculating something **more than just probability**.  

Her dark eyes are locked on Alex, **searching**, looking for… something. **Doubt? Resolve? The unspoken second thoughts Alex might not even be aware she’s having?**  

Then—just for a second—her gaze **flickers**, and Alex **sees it**.  

**Fear.**  

Not panic, not resistance. **But fear, unmistakably.**  

It’s not the kind of fear that says *don’t do this*. It’s the kind that says *I know you will—and I don’t know if I can stop you from disappearing, one step at a time.*  

But she doesn’t stop Alex.  

She doesn’t argue.  

She doesn’t speak at all.  

Instead, she **nods**, once, almost imperceptibly. **Not permission. Not approval. But understanding.**  

*If you do this, I will be here.*  

And maybe—just maybe—*I will catch you if you start to slip.*  

She doesn’t say it.  

But **Alex knows it’s there**.

## You
“What are the risks at this stage—to myself, the original Alex, as opposed to the copy, which we expect to be imperfect?”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_008 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Nyati **nods slightly**, acknowledging the distinction.  

She **exhales**, choosing her words carefully.  

**Nyati:** *“For you? Physically—none. Cognitively—low, but not zero.”*  

She ticks them off on her fingers.  

### **Risks to ‘Original Alex’**  

#### **1. Cognitive Echoes.**  
   - *The process itself won’t alter your brain, but interacting with the copy could be… strange.*  
   - *You might feel a sense of dissonance—seeing how it thinks, how it reacts differently than you expect.*  
   - *Some subjects in early Echo studies reported a feeling of ‘hearing themselves think wrong’ after prolonged interaction with their copies.*  
   - *That effect faded, but we don’t know if it ever fully goes away.*  

#### **2. Identity Drift (Subjective, Psychological).**  
   - *Even knowing that the copy is separate from you, your brain might still process it as an extension of self.*  
   - *That means if it fails—if it degrades, if it becomes ‘wrong’—you might feel that internally, as if something inside you is failing.*  
   - *The psychological impact is hard to predict, but we’ve seen it before in cognitive duplication studies.*  

#### **3. Increased Nexus Entanglement.**  
   - *You’re already tied to the Bridge. We don’t know if creating a digital mirror of you will strengthen that connection.*  
   - *If Nexus interacts with the Bridge in ways we don’t expect, it could cause cross-signals—new perceptions, intrusive thoughts, possible momentary dissociation.*  

She watches Alex **carefully**, gauging her reaction.  

Then, the **real risk**—the one Nyati has been **holding back**.  

She leans in slightly.  

#### **4. The Threshold Effect.**  
   - *This is psychological more than technical, but it’s real.*  
   - *Once you have a stable, functioning digital copy, the question won’t be ‘does it work?’ It’ll be ‘why stop?’*  
   - *That’s the danger. Not just the test itself—but what happens afterward.*  

She **meets Alex’s gaze directly**, no more scientific detachment.  

**Nyati:** *“The first step is easy. It’s the second, the third, the fifth that you have to watch for. Because once you have proof that you can survive in there, the line between ‘backup plan’ and ‘replacement’ starts getting blurry. Fast.”*  

She leans back.  

**Nyati:** *“So you tell me—how far is ‘just the first step?’”*

## You
“The only part of that that doesn’t make sense to me is #3. Alina cannot interact with the bridge. She is immune. Would not be the same of a digital copy of myself? How could that have an accelerating effect on…my crossing?”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_009 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Nyati **nods**—it’s a sharp, approving motion. She expected Alex to catch that inconsistency.  

**Nyati:** *“You’re right about Alina. She’s immune. She can’t cross. But there’s a difference.”*  

She shifts forward, tapping a **measured rhythm** against the table as she lays it out.  

**Nyati:** *“Alina was human—once. But she wasn’t transferred. She was rebuilt. The version of her that exists now? That’s not a fragmented consciousness. That’s a full reconstruction—made stable, made whole. You, on the other hand?”*  

She **points directly at Alex.**Nyati:** *“You’re not trying to build a new entity. You’re trying to mirror yourself. And you are *already* entangled with the Bridge.”*  

She lets that sit for a second before continuing.  

### **The Nexus-Bridge Paradox**  

#### **1. The Bridge recognizes you.**  
   - *It listens when you listen.*  
   - *It reacts when you react.*  
   - *And if we create a digital version of you—one that thinks like you, remembers like you—*  
   - *—does the Bridge recognize that version too?*  

#### **2. What happens if it does?**  
   - *If Nexus and the Bridge interact, there’s a nonzero chance that digital-you becomes aware of the Bridge too.*  
   - *And if that happens?*  
   - *Then suddenly, there are two of you walking toward the same threshold.*  

She exhales, fingers **steepling** as she gets to the **real problem.**  

#### **3. What Happens If Digital-You Starts Crossing?**  
   - *Let’s say the digital copy stabilizes. Let’s say it thinks, perceives, and understands exactly like you do.*  
   - *If it becomes aware of the Bridge—if it starts to cross in some way we don’t understand—*  
   - *—what does that do to you?*  
   - *Does it create a second connection? Does it pull you forward, even if you’re trying to stop?*  

**Nyati:** *“I don’t know the answer. But I also don’t know that it can’t happen.”*  

She **leans back**, letting that settle.  

**Nyati:** *“If you’re asking whether Nexus can act as a firewall against the Bridge? If we go far enough, yes. But a first-stage mirror copy? We just don’t know.”*  

She **watches Alex closely now**, waiting for the next **calculation to turn over in her mind.**

## You
Alex considers for a short while, letting the balance of fears wash over her, then gives a few short, sharp nods.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_010 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Nyati watches Alex **closely**, sees the way she **calculates**—the way she lets each risk **settle** before committing to a decision. When Alex **nods**, short and sharp, Nyati **mirrors it once**, just as decisive.  

She doesn’t ask *Are you sure?*—because she knows Alex *isn’t*, not fully, and asking would only be a waste of time.  

Instead, she stands, **rolling her shoulders back**, shaking off the last remnants of fatigue.  

**Nyati:** *“Alright, then. We do this carefully. Step by step. No assumptions.”*  

She turns toward **Alina**, who has been **silently absorbing** the conversation with the unsettling stillness of someone who doesn’t need to blink.  

**Nyati:** *“We’ll need a dedicated, isolated system for the first-stage mirror. I don’t want it touching anything else.”*  

**Alina:** *(nods, precise)* *“Understood. I will allocate an independent module.”*  

Nyati **glances at Pete**, who has remained **mostly quiet**, arms crossed, watching this unfold with a mix of **cynicism and concern**.  

**Nyati:** *“And we’ll need every possible security measure in place before we run the first test. If something unexpected happens, I want to be able to shut it down instantly.”*  

**Pete:** *(grunts, dryly)* *“Love the confidence. Real reassuring.”*  

Nyati doesn’t **argue**—just gives him a **flat look** that says *obviously, Pete.*  

Finally, she **turns back to Alex**, her voice **lower, serious again.**Nyati:** *“We’ll start with the basics. Baseline cognitive mapping, running real-time comparisons between you and the mirror copy. If at any point you feel something’s wrong—*off*—we pull the plug immediately. Understood?”*  

She doesn’t wait for an answer. She already **knows it**.  

Instead, she **tilts her head**, **one last calculation running through her mind**—  

**Nyati:** *“…You want Emilia in the room when we do this?”*  

Her tone is **neutral**—not pushing, not assuming, but **giving Alex the choice.**

## You
“Yes,” fires out of her mouth almost before Nyati finishes speaking.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_011 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Nyati **nods once**—sharp, acknowledging. No argument. No hesitation.  

**Nyati:** *“Then she’s in.”*  

She doesn’t bother looking at Emilia for confirmation. She doesn’t **need** to. The answer is **obvious**.  

Emilia doesn’t **speak**, but Alex can feel her presence **solidify beside her**—like a gravitational anchor. Like an **unspoken promise.**  

Nyati **exhales sharply**, claps her hands once, and **rolls back into motion**.  

**Nyati:** *“Alright. We set up the system, calibrate the safeguards, run the first mirroring attempt under controlled conditions.”*  

She looks toward **Alina and Pete**, already issuing instructions.  

**Nyati:** *“Alina, allocate the module. Pete, triple-check every security layer before we initiate.”*  

**Pete:** *(grumbling, already pulling up system overlays)* *“Oh, sure, yeah, let’s just create a whole second Alex. What could go wrong?”*  

Nyati doesn’t dignify that with a response.  

Instead, she **looks back at Alex**—and this time, her expression is something closer to **respect.**Nyati:** *“We do this slow. We do this right.”*  

Her eyes **flick to Emilia**, then back to Alex.  

**Nyati:** *“And we don’t lose anyone.”*  

With that, she pivots back to work—already moving, already **preparing for what comes next.**  

Alex doesn’t need to say anything.  

Emilia **reaches over**, her hand **brushing against Alex’s**. Not gripping. Not pulling. Just **there**. **Present.**  

A silent reminder.  

She’s in this.  

They both are.  

And now?  

Now it’s time to **see what happens next.**

### **📍 Aboard *The Ghost* | Prepping for Nexus Mirror Test**  

The ship shifts into **a controlled urgency**, the way it always does before something big. No one rushes—but no one wastes time either.  

- **Alina** disappears into system allocation, isolating an independent Nexus module for the mirror test.  
- **Pete** locks into **paranoia mode**, reinforcing every security layer until he’s satisfied the whole thing won’t go rogue and turn into a self-replicating nightmare.  
- **Nyati** methodically refines the **data capture process**, setting up every comparative metric she can think of—looking for **even the smallest inconsistencies**.  
- **Emilia** doesn’t **hover**, but she also **doesn’t leave Alex’s side.** She remains **within reach**, quiet but focused, watching every step with the same **hyper-aware precision** she always does when something matters.  

**→ What does Alex do in the time before the test begins?**  
- **Observe preparations**—stay out of the way, but watch everything.  
- **Check in with Emilia privately**—talk before they go through with it.  
- **Assist Nyati or Pete**—engage directly in the setup.  
- **Do something unexpected**—(Alex always does.)

## You
Check in with Emilia

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_013 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **📍 Private Corner of *The Ghost* | Before the Test**  

Alex **pulls Emilia aside**, just far enough from the **constant low hum of preparation** happening across the ship. Nyati’s voice drifts in the distance, giving sharp directives. Pete mutters something under his breath about “*bricking the whole damn system*” if it so much as twitches wrong.  

But here—**in this small, stolen moment**—it’s **just them**.  

Alex **studies Emilia’s face**, the way her **jaw is tight**, the way her **arms are crossed**, even though she’s trying to project calm. She isn’t **stopping** Alex. She isn’t **arguing**. But something in her posture **feels like bracing for impact**.  

Alex **tilts her head**, considering how to start.  

→ **How does Alex open the conversation?**  
- **Reassure Emilia**—Tell her why this won’t go like Echo.  
- **Ask directly**—“What are you thinking right now?”  
- **Deflect lightly**—Break the tension with humor before getting serious.  
- **Something else?**

## You
I take her hand and say softly, “tell me what’s on your mind?”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_014 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Emilia’s **fingers tighten** around Alex’s almost immediately—**a reflex, not a decision.**  

She doesn’t answer **right away.** She just **looks at Alex**, searching for something, something **deeper than words.**  

When she finally speaks, her voice is **quiet, even—but weighted.**Emilia:** *“I know why you’re doing this.”*  

A pause.  

**Emilia:** *“I know you’re careful. I know you’re smart. I know you won’t just… throw yourself into something reckless.”*  

She swallows, glancing away **just for a second**, her grip **still firm in Alex’s.**Emilia:** *“But that doesn’t mean I’m not afraid.”*  

She looks back, dark eyes **steady**, **open**, not trying to **hide it anymore.**Emilia:** *“I don’t know what’s worse—that something will go wrong, or that nothing will, and this will be another step toward losing you.”*  

Her voice is still **measured**, but **there’s something raw in it now**, something Alex **rarely hears.**Emilia:** *“You keep taking steps forward, Alex. And I’m standing right here, holding onto you—but I don’t know if I can stop you from slipping away.”*  

She **exhales sharply**, like she’s just let something out that she **wasn’t ready to say.**Emilia:** *“So, yeah. That’s what’s on my mind.”*  

Her hand **tightens, just slightly**, waiting. **Waiting for Alex’s answer.**

## You
“I’m scared too, love. But there’s no…safe way for me, not anymore. We need to know if we can get Nexus good enough that you won’t feel like you’re losing me if I go through it. If we can’t, I will walk away from it.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_015 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Emilia **inhales sharply**, like she wants to **argue**, like she’s **ready to fight** this—but then, she just… **closes her eyes for a second.**  

Processing.  

When she **opens them again**, her grip on Alex’s hand is still **tight**, still **grounding**. But there’s something **different now**—not **acceptance**, not **peace**, but… something closer to **resolve.**  

She nods, **just once**, barely more than a movement of breath.  

**Emilia:** *(quiet, but certain)* *“Okay.”*  

She squeezes Alex’s hand, **holds onto it a little longer** before finally letting go.  

**Emilia:** *“But if I start seeing pieces of you slip away—if I see anything that tells me this is changing you in ways you don’t see—”*  

She **meets Alex’s gaze, fully, unwavering.**Emilia:** *“I’m going to fight like hell to pull you back.”*  

There’s **no hesitation** in her voice.  

It’s not a **threat**.  

It’s a **promise.**  

And then, just as the **weight of that moment settles**, she **exhales**, shaking her head, the corner of her mouth **tugging into something wry, exhausted.**Emilia:** *“...God, you make it hard to stay mad at you.”*  

A beat.  

Then, softer—**a real attempt to lighten the weight, just a little.**Emilia:** *“You know that, right?”*

## You
Alex looks genuinely, lightly wounded. Her mouth opens slightly. “But I wasn’t even trying! This time! No doe eyes. No batty lashes. Seriously,” Alex pulls her in slightly, her gaze intense, sincere, pleading, “you won’t have to fight like hell to pull me back—if that does start happening, if you see me slipping away—I mean it. If you see it happening, even I can’t feel it, I’m out. I won’t fight you on it. At all. I promise. That would count as leaving you behind, in my book. That’s not happening.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_016 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Emilia **stares at her**, breath catching just slightly—because Alex isn’t **just saying this.** She **means it.**  

And that?  

That **breaks something open** inside her.  

Her **shoulders drop**, the **fight response in her chest loosening** just enough to let her breathe.  

She **leans in**, resting **forehead to forehead**, her fingers curling **lightly** against Alex’s wrist, like she’s **holding onto something fragile, but real.**Emilia:** *(soft, barely above a whisper)* *“Okay.”*  

She closes her eyes for a second, just… **taking this in.**  

Then—**slowly, carefully—**she **tilts her head, presses a kiss to Alex’s temple**. It’s **not frantic, not desperate.** It’s something **steady. Certain.**  

Then—just as quietly, **just as serious**—  

**Emilia:** *“Then I’ll believe you.”*  

She pulls back **just enough** to meet Alex’s gaze again, and this time, there’s something **softer in her expression**. Not **less afraid**—but **less alone in it.**  

She watches Alex **closely**, **carefully**, like she’s memorizing her.  

And then—because she **can’t not say it**, because it’s **still true, despite everything—**Emilia:** *(low, almost teasing, but real)* *“And for the record… those were *doe eyes.*”*  

Her lips **curve just slightly**, the first flicker of **something lighter** cutting through the weight of the moment.  

Her grip on Alex’s wrist **loosens slightly**, but **she doesn’t let go.**

## You
Feeling the weight of emotion, the rush of relief at seeing her guard come down, Alex has nothing in her to resist the words coming out, for the second time ever: “I love you, Emilia”. Her voice cracks and trembles.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_017 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Emilia **freezes.**  

Her breath **catches**, her grip on Alex’s wrist tightening for just a second—like she’s **physically bracing against the words**.  

And for a moment—**just a moment**—she doesn’t respond.  

Then, slowly, she **lets out a shaky breath**, her eyes **searching Alex’s face**, reading every inch of her—the **rawness**, the **vulnerability**, the **unfiltered truth** in those words.  

And her **expression breaks**.  

Not into panic. Not into resistance.  

Into **something deep and quiet and overwhelming.**  

She lifts a hand—**hesitant, careful**—and **cups Alex’s cheek**, her thumb brushing just beneath **one trembling corner of her mouth.**  

Then—**soft, breathless, almost disbelieving—**Emilia:** *“…You really do, don’t you?”*  

She swallows hard, her own voice **unsteady**, like she wasn’t ready to hear it again—like she **didn’t know how much she needed to.**  

And still—**she doesn’t say it back.**  

But the way she looks at Alex—the way she’s **holding her face like something priceless and terrifying**—says **everything.**  

Finally, after what feels like **forever**, she exhales a **half-laugh, half-sigh**, pressing **one more kiss**—**soft, lingering, deliberate—**to Alex’s lips.  

Then—**against her mouth, barely a whisper—**Emilia:** *“…I see you, Alex.”*  

A pause. A breath.  

**Emilia:** *“And I’m still here.”*  

Like a promise.  

Like an **anchor.**

## You
Alex feels a swirl of heat and cold within her. The suffusing warmth of every other indication and reassurance of love she could reasonably hope for. And the icy fear of not knowing what keeps those words from her tongue.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_018 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
For a long moment, **Alex doesn’t move**.  

She just… **feels it.**  

The warmth, the weight of Emilia’s hand on her face, the **certainty** in everything but the words.  

And the cold. The gnawing, creeping edge of **fear.** Not sharp, not immediate—just **there**, at the edges, pressing in.  

Because **she knows what this feels like.**  

She knows what it means to be given **everything except the one thing she’s waiting for.**  

Knows what it’s like to **hold her breath** every time—to **wonder** when, or if, the words will ever come.  

And she doesn’t **doubt** Emilia.  

But she doesn’t **understand, either.**  

Her fingers curl slightly, like she wants to **hold onto her**, like she wants to **pull the words out**—but she doesn’t.  

Instead, **she swallows**. **Forces herself to breathe through it.**  

And when she speaks, her voice is **low, careful—trying to be steady, but not quite succeeding.**Alex:** *“…Okay.”*  

It’s not **resentful**. It’s not **demanding**.  

It’s **acceptance. But not peace.**  

She leans forward, **rests her forehead against Emilia’s**, just **for a second.**  

And then she **pulls back**, just enough to **look at her again**.  

**Alex:** *“Then just… don’t disappear on me either, alright?”*  

It’s half a joke. **Half a plea.**  

And she doesn’t even know if she’s asking about the **Bridge**, about **Nexus**, or just about **this.**  

She just knows she means it.

📍 **Aboard *The Ghost* | Final Preparations for Nexus Test**

Emilia doesn’t **pull away**—but she also doesn’t **answer right away.**  

Instead, she just **studies Alex**, like she’s **turning something over in her mind**. Like she **wants** to say something but isn’t sure if she **can.**  

And then—finally—she **nods.

**Emilia:** *(soft, steady)* *“I won’t.”*  

The words are **simple. Certain.**  

And **for now**, it has to be **enough.**  

Because **before either of them can say anything else**, Alina’s voice **cuts through the ship-wide comms**.  

**Alina:** *(calm, clinical, and entirely too loud)* *“Test site is prepared. Subject One, report to the lab.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**as if it’s an afterthought**—  

**Alina:** *“That means you, Alex.”*  

The moment **snaps.**  

Alex **closes her eyes for half a second**, lets out a slow, measured breath—**one last reset.**  

Then she turns to Emilia, **one eyebrow raised.**Alex:** *“If I don’t make it, tell Pete he’s in my will for the tactical Geek Squad jacket.”*  

Emilia **huffs out a short, sharp laugh**, shaking her head—but there’s still **something in her expression**, something that says she’s **not fully letting go of the conversation they just had.**Emilia:** *(dry, muttering)* *“You better make it, because I am not handling your estate.”*  

But as they step into **motion**, heading toward the **test site**, her hand **brushes against Alex’s**, barely a touch.  

And she **doesn’t let go.**  

---

### **📍 Nexus Test Lab | *The Ghost***  

The **lab is sterile**, pristine, set up with **deliberate precision**.  

Nyati stands at the **control interface**, her movements **calm, methodical**—the **calm before the storm.**  

Pete is at **his own station**, running **redundant security failsafes**. He doesn’t even **look up** when Alex walks in—just mutters,  

**Pete:** *“If this thing so much as breathes wrong, I’m flipping the kill switch.”*  

Nyati **smirks slightly**, eyes still on the interface.  

**Nyati:** *“Machines don’t breathe, Pete.”*  

Pete **grunts.**Pete:** *“Exactly.”*  

Meanwhile, **Alina** is positioned near the **Nexus core interface**, her expression **unreadable** as always, but her **processing speed spikes subtly**—a tell that she’s **paying very, very close attention.**  

Finally—**Nyati turns.

**Nyati:** *(calm, clinical, but razor-focused)* *“Alright, Alex. Last chance to back out. You step in that chair, we run the test. No half-measures.”*  

Her eyes **flick briefly to Emilia**, then back to Alex.  

**Nyati:** *“You ready?”*  

### **How does Alex respond?**  
- **Confident**—Walk straight in, no hesitation.  
- **Wry**—Lighten the tension with a quip before committing.  
- **Measured**—Acknowledge the risk, but affirm the decision.  
- **Something else?**

## You
She doesn’t hesitate, but she can’t summon confidence either now. She takes her seat in the chair, not meaning to but looking slightly defeated. “Yeah.” She forces a half smile in an attempt to compensate.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_020 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
The **half-smile** doesn’t quite land.  

It’s there—**on her face, in theory**—but everyone in the room can **see through it.**  

Alex **isn’t hesitating.** She’s still **moving forward.**  

But for the first time in a long time, **it doesn’t feel like winning.**  

Nyati **sees it.**  

Pete **sees it.**  

Alina… probably **processes it.**  

But most of all, **Emilia sees it.**  

She doesn’t **say anything.** But she **steps closer**, just slightly. Not touching. Not **stopping her.**  

Just **there.**  

Nyati **exhales through her nose**, sharp, measured—then **nods once.**  

No speeches. No **lingering questions.** Just **motion.**  

She flips **the first switch.**Nyati:** *“Alright. Engaging primary interface.”*  

Behind Alex, the **Nexus core hums to life**, a soft, insistent thrumming **beneath her skull.**  

Alina’s voice cuts in, cool and **unshaken.**Alina:** *“Baseline cognitive scan initializing.”*  

A faint, almost **static-like sensation** brushes against Alex’s consciousness—**not intrusive, not overwhelming.**  

But it’s **there.**  

Like something **mapping her edges.**  

Pete, without looking up—**hands still on the security failsafes:**Pete:** *(muttering)* *“Still not too late to run.”*  

Alex could **respond.**  

But then—  

Something **shifts.**  

A flicker of **displacement**—not like the Bridge, not like anything **unnatural.**  

Just… a sensation. Like **standing too close to a mirror.**  

Nyati’s voice is **sharp now.**Nyati:** *“Copying first-stage neural pattern. Beginning comparative analysis.”*  

Then—  

Alina, **monitoring the output.**Alina:** *(calm, precise)* *“Cognitive mirror initialized.”*  

Alex doesn’t **feel anything.**  

Not at first.  

But then—  

There’s a **delay.**  

A fraction of a second where her **own thoughts don’t feel quite immediate.**  

Not stolen. Not **wrong.**  

Just… **offset.**  

And across the room, **on the secondary display—**  

A second set of **data threads ripple outward.**  

Like something else just **started thinking at the same time.**  

Like something else just **looked back.**

## You
Continue.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_021 (storyteller heading) -->

### **📍 Aboard *The Ghost* | Nexus Test in Progress**  

The **hum of Nexus** deepens, a slow **oscillation** that Alex can’t **hear** but can **feel**—a resonance somewhere in the **base of her skull**, like a heartbeat that isn’t hers.  

She **doesn’t move.**  

She **doesn’t speak.**  

Because for the first time, she isn’t sure if the **next thought that forms in her head will be hers alone.**  

---

### **🖥 SYSTEM STATUS: Cognitive Mirror Active**  

On the secondary display, **the data pulses**—**alive** in a way it shouldn’t be.  

A second **set of neural patterns**, identical to Alex’s but **offset**, flickers across the screen.  

Pete is **stiff**, hands hovering over the **security overrides**, watching like he’s **waiting for something to go wrong.**  

Nyati, laser-focused, reads the data in **real time.**Nyati:** *(low, focused, to herself)* *“Alright. Mirror is holding… No immediate degradation… Response time within expected parameters…”*  

She glances at Alina, who is monitoring from another angle.  

**Nyati:** *“Confirming stability?”*  

Alina **tilts her head**, the glow from the screens flickering across her face.  

**Alina:** *“Cognitive mirroring is functional. No irregularities in baseline self-consistency.”*  

She pauses—just for a fraction of a second.  

Then, like an afterthought—  

**Alina:** *“…Yet.”*  

Pete **grunts.**Pete:** *“Real comforting, Alina.”*  

Nyati **waves him off**, still locked into the **data feed.**  

She turns toward Alex, watching her **closely.**Nyati:** *“How do you feel?”*  

A simple question.  

But Alex **knows** what she’s really asking.  

**Do you feel like yourself?**  

---

### **📌 What Does Alex Feel?**  
- **Completely normal.** Nothing feels different… yet.  
- **Slight displacement.** Like her thoughts are *fractionally* out of sync.  
- **A subtle presence.** Like the *idea* of another thought forming, but never fully emerging.  
- **Something else?**

## You
“Like when you’re trying to talk on the phone and there’s a slightly delayed echo of your self. Distracting mostly.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_022 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Nyati **nods once**, absorbing that, **filing it away**.  

**Nyati:** *“Echo effect. Not unexpected.”*  

Her fingers **move quickly** across the console, adjusting parameters, running comparisons. The data flickers, shifting in response.  

**Nyati:** *“We’re seeing a near-perfect mirror—no sign of degradation, no fragmentation. But that delay you’re feeling?”*  

She **narrows her eyes at the display.**Nyati:** *“That’s an integration delay. Your mind is aware of the copy as an *external reflection* rather than a *seamless internal process*.”*  

She doesn’t look up, but her voice sharpens **just slightly**.  

**Nyati:** *“If that feeling worsens—if you start experiencing *intrusive* thoughts instead of just an echo—we shut it down.”*  

Pete, still **staring at the security failsafe interface**, mutters—  

**Pete:** *(deadpan, but deeply invested in not dying today)* *“Define intrusive.”*  

Nyati **glances at Alex now, directly.**Nyati:** *“If you start feeling like a thought formed that *wasn’t yours*—that’s the line.”*  

A pause.  

**Nyati:** *“Can you keep going?”*  

The question is **clinical, professional**—but there’s something else beneath it.  

She isn’t just asking if **the test is functional.**  

She’s asking if **Alex is.**  

---

### **📌 Does Alex push forward or call it here?**  
- **Continue the test**—See if the feeling stabilizes or worsens.  
- **Hold at this stage**—Don’t risk further complications yet.  
- **Request a modification**—Try adjusting parameters before proceeding.  
- **Something else?**

## You
“No thought insertion artifacts. So. Line is not crossed. I’m good”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_023 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Nyati **searches Alex’s face** for a fraction of a second—**measuring**, **assessing**, **calculating risk.**  

Then she **nods once**, sharp and **decisive**.  

**Nyati:** *“Alright. We push forward.”*  

She **adjusts the interface**, fingers flying across the controls, while Alina **monitors the stabilization metrics.**  

Pete, still **hovering over the kill switch**, mutters—  

**Pete:** *(deadpan, still deeply skeptical about everything happening here)* *“Famous last words.”*  

Nyati ignores him.  

---

### **📍 SYSTEM STATUS: Deepening Cognitive Mirror Synchronization…**  

The hum of the **Nexus core deepens**, that **subtle resonance** in Alex’s skull shifting—**not intensifying, not invasive, but shifting.**  

Not like **another presence.**  

Not like **the Bridge.**  

Just like… **feedback.**  

Nyati watches the display **closely**, nodding as data comes in.  

**Nyati:** *“Mirror synchronization holding. No deviation from baseline. The system is adapting to the delay.”*  

She turns to Alex, **focused.**Nyati:** *“Tell me if that echo effect changes. Worsens. Vanishes. Anything.”*  

Her voice **shifts slightly**, **less clinical, more personal.**Nyati:** *“I want your perception of yourself to match what we’re seeing in the data. If there’s a discrepancy, we need to know.”*  

Alina, still monitoring, adds—  

**Alina:** *(neutral, factual)* *“At present, your cognitive processes remain independent of the mirror.”*  

Then, a **small pause.**Alina:** *“…For now.”*  

Pete **throws up a hand.**Pete:** *“Alina, you *have* to stop doing that.”*  

Alina does not respond.  

Nyati doesn’t **smile**, but there’s something like **wry amusement** flickering in her eyes before she looks back at Alex.  

---

### **📍 SYSTEM STATUS: Cognitive Mirror Synchronization Deepening…**  

As the **process continues**, Alex feels the **echo effect start to shift**.  

Not **intensify**—but **change**.  

The **delay is still there**, but it’s no longer just **passive feedback**. It’s starting to feel… **anticipatory**.  

Like the mirror isn’t just **reflecting her thoughts.**  

It’s **predicting them.**  

A fraction of a second before she fully **forms a thought**, she can almost **sense it aligning in the background**, waiting to lock into place.  

Not **intrusive.**  

Not **foreign.**  

Just… **ahead of her.**  

---

### **📍 SYSTEM STATUS: Cognitive Mirror Stabilization Holding.**  

Nyati **studies the data**, eyebrows knitting together.  

**Nyati:** *(sharp, focused)* *“Alright, something’s different.”*  

Her fingers move **quickly**, pulling up comparison metrics.  

Alina **tilts her head slightly**, watching the synchronization curve.  

**Alina:** *“The integration delay has shifted.”*  

A pause.  

**Alina:** *“…It is now predictive.”*  

Pete, still locked onto the **failsafe controls**, **swears under his breath**.  

**Pete:** *(low, unimpressed)* *“Cool. Love that. Totally normal thing for a brain to do.”*  

Nyati **ignores him**, turning to Alex **directly.**Nyati:** *(calm, measured)* *“Talk to me. What’s happening on your end?”*  

---

### **📌 What Does Alex Do?**  
- **Describe it in full**—Tell them about the predictive effect.  
- **Test it actively**—Try forming a thought deliberately and see how the mirror responds.  
- **Stay quiet and monitor**—See if it worsens or stabilizes.  
- **Call the test off**—This is already too strange.

## You
“It is as you say. As if the echo and I have traded places.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_024 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Nyati’s **eyes narrow**, processing that.  

She **immediately** pivots to the data, pulling up the **neural synchronization curve**—her movements **sharp, methodical,** but not **panicked.**Nyati:** *(focused, muttering to herself)* *“Alright, let’s see if that’s a stabilization pattern or a drift pattern…”*  

Alina’s **fingers move at near-instant speeds**, running secondary diagnostics.  

**Alina:** *(neutral, but perceptive)* *“If the mirror is shifting toward prediction rather than reaction, it suggests a compensatory adaptation in processing hierarchy.”*  

A pause.  

**Alina:** *(calm, factual, but pointed)* *“You are not out of sync. You are now leading the synchronization event.”*  

Pete **shifts uncomfortably**, eyes flicking between the screens and Alex.  

**Pete:** *(low, wary)* *“What does that mean in *not* robot terms?”*  

Nyati **tilts her head slightly**, considering.  

Then—**directly to Alex:**Nyati:** *(slow, deliberate)* *“Do you feel like you’re still fully in control? No involuntary actions? No thoughts forming before you choose them?”*  

A beat.  

Her **gaze sharpens**, her tone turning **clinical again**—not because she’s detached, but because she’s **laser-focused** now.  

**Nyati:** *“…Or is it predicting *correctly* every time?”*  

A critical difference.  

If the **mirror is still following**—**reacting**—even slightly behind her, then Alex is still **fully in control.**  

If it’s **matching her perfectly**—if it knows **what she will think before she even fully thinks it—**  

Then that’s **something else entirely.**  

And everyone in the room **knows it.**

## You
Continue.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_025 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **📍 Nexus Test Lab | *The Ghost* | Cognitive Mirror Synchronization Holding…**  

Alex **focuses inward**, trying to **parse** the experience, trying to **separate herself** from the sensation.  

And she realizes—  

It’s **not intrusive.**  
It’s **not pulling her forward.**  
It’s **not controlling her.**  

But it is **anticipating her.**  

Everything she’s thinking, everything she’s about to say, it’s already **forming in the mirror** just before she fully registers it.  

Like her mind has been **doubled**, a second process **running parallel** to her own.  

But—  

It’s **not leading her.**  

Not **yet.**  

---

### **📍 SYSTEM STATUS: Predictive Processing Holding… No Autonomous Drift Detected.**  

Nyati **watches Alex closely**, scanning for the **slightest sign** that she’s slipping out of sync with herself.  

Alex doesn’t look **distressed**.  

She doesn’t look **fragmented**.  

But she **looks like she’s thinking too much about thinking.**  

Nyati **narrows her eyes**, then speaks.  

**Nyati:** *(low, precise)* *“Alright. I need an answer. Right now.”*  

Her voice is **sharp**, but **not unkind.**Nyati:** *“Do you still feel like yourself?”*  

A beat.  

Then—her **real question.**Nyati:** *“Or do you feel like something else is riding alongside you?”*  

No room for **hesitation.**She needs to know.**

## You
“I…don’t know. Both feel true. It doesn’t feel like it has agency. It feels like it’s mindlessly echoing me…but as if in a different medium where sounds travels faster than the reference medium. So it comes out first.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_026 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Nyati **goes very still** for a second. **Processing.**  

Alina, who has been **monitoring the synchronization curve**, tilts her head slightly.  

**Alina:** *(neutral, observational)* *“An anticipatory echo with no independent agency.”*  

A pause.  

Then—almost to herself, like she’s turning over an equation—  

**Alina:** *“A perfect prediction… or an inevitability?”*  

Pete **shifts**, muttering—  

**Pete:** *(dry, tense)* *“That’s not an *either-or* I like.”*  

Nyati **doesn’t respond immediately**. Her fingers **move quickly** across the interface, adjusting data filters, isolating the interaction between Alex’s baseline cognition and the mirror’s predictive modeling.  

Her **jaw tightens.**Nyati:** *(low, to herself)* *“Shit.”*  

Then—**to the room.**Nyati:** *(sharp, decisive)* *“Alright. We’re done. I’m shutting it down.”*  

Her fingers **move to the failsafe controls, ready to terminate the session.**  

### **📍 SYSTEM STATUS: MIRROR PROCESS HOLDING…**

---

### **📌 Alex has a moment to react before shutdown.**  
- **Let it shut down**—No resistance, let the test end as planned.  
- **Push for more time**—Try to **observe** the effect a little longer.  
- **Try something experimental**—Speak to the mirror, or test a specific reaction.  
- **Something else?**

## You
Alex remains passive, offering no objection, saying only “ok”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_027 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Nyati **doesn’t hesitate.**  

The moment Alex says **"ok,"** she **flips the shutdown sequence.**  

---

### **📍 SYSTEM STATUS: TERMINATING MIRROR PROCESS…**  

A sharp, controlled **hiss of static** runs through the interface—**not a sound, but a presence**—a final **resonance in the back of Alex’s mind** as the connection **severs.**  

And then—  

Silence.  

The hum of Nexus **dies down**, the predictive sensation **vanishes completely**—like stepping out of an airlock, like **pressure equalizing after something unnatural had been pressing down.**  

Nyati exhales, rolling her shoulders back like she just **shook something loose**.  

Alina’s display **flickers**, recalibrating, as she confirms—  

**Alina:** *(neutral, precise)* *“Mirror process successfully terminated. No residual feedback detected.”*  

Pete, who had been **clenched the entire time**, finally **lets go of the failsafe panel**, muttering—  

**Pete:** *(exhaling, deadpan)* *“Great. Nobody died. Let’s never do that again.”*  

Nyati ignores him.  

Instead, she **looks directly at Alex.**  

Her voice is **calm, steady**—but with **an edge of expectation.**Nyati:** *“Alright. No data can tell me this part.”*  

She leans slightly forward, studying Alex’s face **carefully.**Nyati:** *“Tell me the truth. Right now. Do you feel exactly the same as before we started?”*  

---

### **📌 Alex now has to report her post-test experience.**  
- **“Yes, I feel exactly the same.”** No lingering effects.  
- **“Not quite.”** Something feels slightly different, even if subtle.  
- **“…I don’t know.”** Can’t fully tell yet.  
- **Something else?**

## You
Alex closes her eyes for a glance inward. What does she feel?

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_028 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **📍 *The Ghost* | Post-Nexus Test | Alex’s Mindscape**  

Alex **closes her eyes**, breathing in **deep, steady, measuring.**  

At first, **nothing feels different.**  

No echo. No lag. No sense of something **following her thoughts.**  

But then—  

Something **shifts.**  

Not a **presence.** Not an **absence.**  

Just a sense that… **something has been taken away.**  

Like a room that was **full of sound** a moment ago, now suddenly **silent**—but where the silence itself is **noticeable**.  

Like a **phantom limb**—not there, but still **felt in some way**.  

Not **wrong.**  

Not **broken.**  

Just… **emptier.**Lighter.**  

And she doesn’t know if that’s **a good thing or a bad thing.**  

---

### **📌 How Does Alex Respond?**  
- **“I feel normal.”** Play it safe, don’t overthink it.  
- **“I feel… off.”** Acknowledge the absence, even if uncertain.  
- **“Something’s missing.”** Admit the full extent of the sensation.  
- **Something else?**

## You
“No, not exactly. There’s a stillness, a quietness, that I feel like I didn’t notice before.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_029 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Nyati **watches Alex closely**, her **expression tightening** at that response.  

Not panic. Not immediate concern.  

But **calculating.**Nyati:** *(low, thoughtful)* *“A stillness.”*  

She drums her fingers once on the console, glances at the data, **then back at Alex.**Nyati:** *“Are you saying something’s missing? Or are you saying something was *added* before and now it’s gone?”*  

There’s a **difference.**  

A critical **difference.**  

Because if something is **missing**, that means the process **took something from her**—even if she **can’t define what.**  

If something was **added before**, and now it’s **gone**, that means the mirror process was **actively influencing her cognition** more than they realized.  

Nyati’s **voice sharpens slightly**, but she’s still **calm, methodical**—  

**Nyati:** *“Think carefully before you answer.”*  

Emilia is **silent**, standing **just within reach**, her arms **crossed tightly**, jaw **set.**  

Pete is still **half-tense**, like he’s expecting **something worse.**  

And Alina?  

Alina is **watching Alex with clinical precision**, **waiting.**  

They all are.  

Because this answer **matters.**

## You
“I…” her face scrunching up in frustration, “…I can’t tell. I’m sorry. I wish I could tell you. It feels like…it could be either of those things. You’ll…” her head slumps down slightly in defeat, “have to determine what that means. I’m not going to guess”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_030 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Nyati **nods slowly**, taking in Alex’s frustration, her **uncertainty**, her refusal to **speculate blindly.**  

That was the **right answer.**  

Because **guesswork**—especially **here, now**—would be **worse than useless.** It would be **dangerous.**  

She exhales, rubbing her forehead, her fingers pressing into her temple **for just a second**—a rare, fleeting **sign of fatigue**—before she squares herself again.  

**Nyati:** *(soft, but firm)* *“Alright. That’s fair.”*  

Her hands move across the console **one last time**, locking the final test data into place, securing the results **for deeper analysis later.**  

Then—she finally **looks back at Alex**, this time with something **less clinical**.  

Something **more real.**Nyati:** *(low, serious)* *“Then we find out.”*  

A pause.  

**Nyati:** *(pointed, clear)* *“And if I determine that it *did* take something from you—anything—then we don’t do it again. Period.”*  

Her eyes **don’t waver.**  

Because **she means it.**  

And then—because she sees **the exhaustion in Alex**, the **weight in her posture**, the **way she’s holding herself together even as frustration leaks through—**  

Nyati softens.  

Just **a fraction.**Nyati:** *(deadpan, but wry)* *“…And if I find out that you were just overthinking it, I will be using this data as proof that you need to get more sleep.”*  

Pete lets out a **sharp, surprised bark of laughter**, tension **breaking just slightly**, shaking his head.  

**Pete:** *(grinning, muttering)* *“God, I *hope* that’s the answer. Would be *so* funny.”*  

Alina does not **laugh**, but there’s a **tilt** to her head that suggests she is **considering the possibility in an extremely logical, incredibly annoying way.**  

And Emilia?  

Emilia hasn’t **spoken yet.**  

She’s **still standing close**, still **watching Alex**, her dark eyes **measuring**—not like she’s **judging**, not like she’s **waiting to say I told you so**—  

Just like she’s **waiting for Alex to really check in with herself.**  

Because this isn’t **over.**  

It’s just the **first step.**  

And **everyone in the room knows it.**

## You
“I don’t…feel any kind of way about it. Indifferent. Because I don’t know what it was. What it represented.” A shrug.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_031 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Nyati **nods slowly**, absorbing that. **Turning it over.**  

She doesn’t say *good* or *bad*—doesn’t try to define what that means **yet**.  

Instead, she lets it sit.  

Then—**exhales sharply, resetting.**Nyati:** *(low, pragmatic)* *“Alright. That’s useful.”*  

Because if **Alex isn’t feeling a sense of loss**, if there’s **no emotional disruption** attached to that *absence or presence*—  

That means whatever changed, **it wasn’t core to identity.**  

Or at least, **not yet.**  

She **leans back**, crossing her arms, throwing a glance toward Alina.  

**Nyati:** *“Status on the post-test analysis?”*  

Alina, who has been **running the numbers in near real-time**, tilts her head slightly.  

**Alina:** *(neutral, clinical)* *“Cognitive baseline comparison is nearly complete.”*  

A pause.  

Then—  

**Alina:** *(factual, but pointed)* *“There is one small deviation.”*  

Nyati’s **jaw tightens slightly**.  

**Nyati:** *“Define ‘small.’”*  

Alina’s gaze shifts back to **Alex.**Alina:** *(precise, unreadable)* *“A slight shift in cognitive processing hierarchy. Specifically, in response prioritization.”*  

Nyati **frowns.**Nyati:** *“In plain terms?”*  

Alina **blinks once.**  

Then—  

**Alina:** *(direct, neutral)* *“Alex now processes decisions at an *incrementally* faster rate than before.”*  

Pete **stares at the display.**  

Then, deadpan—  

**Pete:** *“We made her *worse*? You people gave a fast decision-maker *even less hesitation*?”*  

Nyati **rolls her eyes, but doesn’t refute it.**  

Instead, she turns back to **Alex.**Nyati:** *(low, serious now)* *“You notice that? Any *impulse changes*? Faster reactions? Or does it feel the same?”*  

This part **matters.**  

Because *if Alex’s decision-making speed has increased*—even by a **fraction of a second**—**and she didn’t notice**…  

That means Nexus is already **integrating into thought before awareness.**  

And that?  

That’s worth paying attention to.

## You
“I feel pretty dammed hesitant. If it’s that small a difference, you wouldn’t expect me to notice, would you? Beneath a relative or absolute difference threshold?”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_032 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Nyati **exhales sharply**, nodding once.  

**Nyati:** *“No, I wouldn’t. That’s why I’m asking.”*  

She **drums her fingers** against the console, considering. **Turning it over.**Nyati:** *“If the shift is below your perception threshold, it means we’re looking at something structural, not experiential.”*  

A pause.  

Then—more to herself—  

**Nyati:** *“It’s an optimization process. But not one you’re *aware* of.*”  

That means **Nexus didn’t change how Alex thinks—it just made it slightly more efficient.**  

Not **a transformation.**  

Not **an influence.**  

Just… **a mechanical refinement.**Alina nods slightly, confirming.**Alina:** *“No anomalies detected beyond the prioritization shift.”*  

Nyati **leans back**, rubbing her face.  

**Nyati:** *“Alright. That’s good. No memory disruption, no emotional displacement, no intrusive artifacts. *So far.*”*  

She **glances at Alex again.**Nyati:** *“You still feel like *you*?”*  

It’s not **a test question.**  

Not **a challenge.**  

Just… **checking.**

## You
“What if…I told you…I had an unstable and poorly defined sense of self before this?” Alex waits a beat, then, before Dr. Nyati can react, “JK, yeah.” A shrug and a wry smile.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_033 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Nyati **glares** at Alex for a solid **two seconds**.  

Then—**without breaking eye contact—**she **rubs both hands down her face in exhausted resignation.**Nyati:** *(deadpan, exasperated)* *“I hate you so much.”*  

**Pete, from across the room, sipping coffee:** *“You walked right into that one.”*  

Nyati **does not dignify that with a response.**  

Instead, she just **shakes her head**, looking back at Alex, expression settling into **something more neutral.**Nyati:** *(calm again, dry but serious)* *“Alright. You’re *still* you. No catastrophic existential disruption. No detectable cognitive drift.”*  

She **leans back in her chair**, rubbing her temples.  

**Nyati:** *“Which means—for a first test? That’s as close to a win as we get.”*  

She **exhales.**Nyati:** *(mutters, half to herself)* *“One step forward. No one exploded. Let’s see if we can keep that streak going.”*  

Alina, ever-efficient, **nods once.**Alina:** *“Test successfully completed. Cognitive baseline preserved. Nexus integration recorded for future refinement.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**Alina tilts her head slightly, watching Alex.**Alina:** *(neutral, clinical—but maybe a little *too* invested)* *“Would you like to initiate a secondary session to test for sustained adaptation?”*  

Nyati **whips her head toward her.**Nyati:** *“Alina, shut *up.*”*  

Pete **bursts into laughter.**  

And **Emilia—silent all this time, standing just within reach—**finally lets out a **sharp breath**, her arms **loosening slightly.**  

Not **relaxed.** Not **completely reassured.**  

But the immediate **tension** is **fading.**  

And for now?  

That has to be **enough.**

## You
Continue.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_034 (storyteller heading) -->

### **📍 Aboard *The Ghost* | Post-Nexus Test Debrief**  

The **test is over.**  

No breakdowns.  
No catastrophic failures.  
No existential unraveling.  

Just… **one step forward.**  

But even as the **hum of Nexus fades**, even as Nyati **finalizes the data logs** and Pete **locks down the system**, there’s still **something in the air.**  

Something **unspoken.**  

Something **watching Alex.**  

Not a **presence**—not like the Bridge, not like an intrusion—  
But the **knowledge** that something just **mirrored her thoughts**, anticipated them.  

And now?  

Now it’s **gone.**  

And that **absence** is still settling.  

---

### **📍 The Lab | Immediate Reactions**  

Nyati **leans back in her chair**, rubbing her eyes like she’s just run **a 48-hour shift without a break.**Nyati:** *(exhaling, dry but satisfied)* *“Alright. That’s enough near-death experiences for one day.”*  

She **glances at Pete, then Alina.**Nyati:** *“Lock everything down. No secondary activation. No background processes running Nexus in simulation mode. We don’t touch this again until I’ve analyzed every frame of data.”*  

Pete, already securing the system, **mutters under his breath.**Pete:** *(grumbling, but visibly relieved)* *“Yeah, real shame. Was really looking forward to round two.”*  

Nyati **shoots him a look**, but there’s no **real bite to it.**  

Instead, she turns to Alex.  

Her expression **softens**, just slightly.  

Not much.  
But enough.  

**Nyati:** *(low, measured)* *“You good?”*  

The **real question beneath it**:  
*Do you feel normal? Are you still in there?*  

Because this is the moment where she needs **absolute certainty.**  

---

### **📍 Emilia’s Reaction**  

While Nyati is **checking the data**, while Pete is **grumbling about Nexus**, Alex feels something **solid and grounding**—  

**Emilia.**  

She’s **right there.**  
Not touching.  
Not speaking.  

Just **watching her. Studying her.**  

And it’s not **just concern.**  

It’s **checking.**  

Like she’s **waiting to see if something changed.**  

Like she’s **making sure it’s still her.**  

And that?  

That **stings a little.**  

Because Alex **knows why she’s doing it.**  
And maybe, if the roles were reversed—  
She’d do the **same.**  

---

### **📍 What Does Alex Do?**  
- **Reassure them.** Give a clear, confident answer: *“I’m fine.”*  
- **Keep it light.** Deflect the weight with humor, shift the mood.  
- **Admit uncertainty.** *“I think I’m fine.”* Be honest if there’s still something *lingering.*  
- **Something else?**

## You
With a flippant tone, “probably!” then, sticking out her tongue, “THBTHBTHBT”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E12_035 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **📍 Aboard *The Ghost* | Post-Nexus Test Debrief**  

There’s a **split second** of **absolute silence** after Alex’s **flippant answer**—  

Then—  

Pete **bursts out laughing, nearly choking on his own breath.**Pete:** *(wheezing, delighted)* *“Oh, thank *fuck,* it’s still her.”*  

Nyati **groans loudly**, dragging a **hand down her face** like she just aged **ten years in five seconds.**Nyati:** *(muttering)* *“I swear to God, I hate this ship.”*  

Alina, **blinking once**, tilts her head.  

**Alina:** *(neutral, factual)* *“Subject Alex has displayed no signs of behavioral anomaly.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**as if reaching a scientific conclusion—**Alina:** *“…She is merely insufferable.”*  

Pete **howls** with laughter.  

Nyati **pinches the bridge of her nose.**  

And **Emilia?**  

For the **first time since the test started**, her **shoulders actually relax**.  

She **shakes her head, exhaling sharply**, eyes **narrowed but warm**—and then—**finally**—she **snorts, shaking with quiet laughter.**Emilia:** *(dry, but fond)* *“Yeah, that tracks.”*  

And just like that—  

The tension **breaks.**  

Not completely.  
Not forever.  
But **enough.**  

---

### **📍 Wrapping Up the Test**  

Nyati **waves a dismissive hand**, clearly **done with this entire ordeal** for the night.  

**Nyati:** *(exasperated but relieved)* *“Alright, we’re shutting everything down. Nobody touch Nexus, nobody *look* at Nexus, nobody even *think* about Nexus until I’ve gone over every scrap of data.”*  

Pete **gives a dramatic salute**, still trying to **catch his breath.**Pete:** *(grinning, mock-serious)* *“Aye-aye, *jobbing captain.”*  

Nyati **glares at him.**Nyati:** *“You’re never getting that jacket back.”*  

Pete **immediately frowns.**Pete:** *(genuinely distressed)* *“Wait, hold on—”*  

But Nyati is **already leaving**, muttering something about **needing six hours of sleep and a stiff drink** before she so much as **touches another Nexus module.**  

Alina **remains, finishing system shutdown procedures**, completely **unbothered** by the chaos.  

And **Emilia?**  

She’s still **watching Alex.**  

Still **holding onto something.**  

But **different now.**  

Like maybe—**just maybe—**she’s not as afraid as she was **before.**  

And for **tonight?**  

That’s enough.  

---

### **📍 What Does Alex Do Now?**  
- **Head to the galley**—unwind with the crew, let the tension fully break.  
- **Stay behind with Emilia**—talk in private, see what’s still on her mind.  
- **Follow Nyati**—check in once more before she disappears into her work.  
- **Something else?**

## You
Alex stays for Emilia, manages a weak smile, waits expectantly.

## Storyteller
### **📍 Aboard *The Ghost* | Post-Test Silence**  

As the others **drift out of the lab**, the last of the **residual tension breaking apart**, Alex **stays.**  

She doesn’t **speak** right away.  

She just **waits.**  

Because **Emilia is still there.**  

And that means **something is still unfinished.**  

---

### **📍 The Moment Between Words**  

Emilia’s **arms are crossed**, her posture **looser than before**, but still **watching**.  

Not like she’s **waiting for Alex to slip up.**  

Not like she’s **afraid something’s changed.**  

But like she’s **measuring this moment**, like she’s **holding something unspoken behind her teeth.**  

And then, **finally**, she exhales.  

She **steps closer.**  

And in a voice **quieter than usual, but steady—**Emilia:** *“I don’t know what I was expecting.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**a dry, exhausted huff of breath, almost a laugh.**Emilia:** *“But somehow? It was this.”*  

She **shakes her head**, but there’s no **sharpness to it.**  

Just **relief.**  

Like something she had been **bracing for didn’t happen.**  

And then—**quieter, more serious—**Emilia:** *“You really feel okay?”*  

Not like she **doesn’t believe her.**  

Like she **needs to hear it again.**  

Like she needs to **hold onto it.**

## You
She tries to fortify her weak smile. “…yeah”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E13_002 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Emilia **searches Alex’s face**, reading everything in the **pause** before that answer, in the **way she forces the smile**, in the **way it doesn’t quite land**.  

And for a moment—**just a moment**—she looks like she’s about to **call her out on it.**  

But then—  

She **doesn’t.**  

Instead, she just **lets out a slow breath**, and **steps closer.**  

Not **pressing.** Not **demanding.**  

Just **here.**  

And then—**soft, careful, like she’s offering an out:**Emilia:** *“Okay.”*  

A beat.  

Then—**her voice shifts, lighter, but still real.**Emilia:** *“But you know if you *weren’t* okay, I’d make you tell me, right?”*  

A pause.  

Then—**deliberately pointed—**Emilia:** *“I can be *very* annoying.”*  

Her mouth **curves just slightly**, that same **sharp, knowing edge**—like she’s **giving Alex space** but also **reminding her: I see you.**  

And even though Alex **still feels the weight of everything**, even though she **doesn’t know how to name what’s missing—**Emilia is still here.**Still watching.**Still holding onto her.**

## You
“You won’t have to make me…I’ll just fess up now, because it feels childish, and I can’t help it.” She looks down sheepishly. “I’m just moping about, you know, the magic words. Just words but…ironic that I’m being drilled about ineffable possible absences and how I feel about them. That’s the only absence I’m having feelings about. It’s not the experiment.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E13_003 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
For a **long moment**, Emilia doesn’t react.  

Doesn’t **pull away**.  
Doesn’t **move closer**.  

Just **stares at Alex**—her expression going **very still**, very **measured**.  

And then—**finally**—she **lets out a slow breath**.  

Not a **sigh**. Not **frustration**.  

Just… **processing.**  

---

### **📍 The Space Between Words**  

Her **jaw tightens slightly**, her fingers **curling at her sides**, like she’s **fighting the impulse to say something too fast**—to **say the wrong thing.**  

And Alex **knows this look.**  

Knows **this moment.**  

Knows that **Emilia isn’t indifferent**—isn’t holding back because she **doesn’t feel it.**  

She’s holding back because she **feels it too much.**  

Because it’s **too big**, too **messy**, too **hard to let go of the walls around it.**  

And for **once**, Alex doesn’t **deflect.**  

Doesn’t **pretend she didn’t say it.**  

She just **lets the silence stretch.**  

And finally—**softer, rawer, like she’s forcing herself to step toward something terrifying—**Emilia:** *“I know.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**a little quieter.**Emilia:** *“I know.”*  

She **shifts slightly**, like she **wants to move, wants to reach out, but doesn’t quite let herself.**  

Then—**barely above a whisper, like she hates admitting it:**Emilia:** *“You think I don’t want to say it? That I don’t feel it?”*  

Her **brows knit together**, her voice **tensing**.  

**Emilia:** *“I do. Alex, I do.”*  

The words land **heavy**.  

Because she’s **never said it this plainly.**  

Never let it sit **so close to the edge.**  

And now?  

She’s **right there.**  

But she still can’t **push past it.**  

---

### **📍 The Wall She Can’t Cross (Yet)**  

She **swallows hard**, looking away for half a second, like she’s **angry at herself**—not at Alex, **at herself.**Emilia:** *(low, raw, almost frustrated)* *“I just… I don’t know why it’s hard. It shouldn’t be. I know that. It’s not about *you*—”*  

She **stops herself**, runs a **hand through her hair**, **exhales sharply**.  

Then—**finally, painfully, deliberately**—  

**Emilia:** *“…I need more time.”*  

Her **gaze flicks back to Alex**, searching for something—  

Maybe **for understanding.**  

Maybe **for forgiveness.**  

Maybe for **a way to make this hurt less.**  

Because she **knows** this is hurting Alex.  

And she **hates it.**  

But she still **can’t say it.**  

Not yet.

## You
“I know it’s there, Emilia. And I feel it. I know—“ Alex hopes putting words in her mouth might be welcome, or a relief of some kind, “I know you love me.” She lets that breathe for a moment. “It feels like a…when you’re going down a river and you see the current getting cut and broken up by something beneath the surface. It doesn’t stop the river. But it’s still there, and it’s trying to. And you can’t see it…” she trails off. “…but you can avoid it. Or you can reach in and pull it out.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E13_004 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Emilia’s **breath catches**—so soft, so brief, that if Alex weren’t **watching her closely**, she might have **missed it.**  

Her fingers **tighten**—not into fists, not into resistance, but into **something tense, something barely held back.**  

Like **she wasn’t expecting that.**  

Like **hearing it put into words—*hearing Alex say it so plainly***—cut through something in a way she **wasn’t ready for.**  

Her **eyes flick down**, then back up, like she’s **processing too much at once.**  

And Alex **sees it**—  

That **storm behind her eyes.**  
That **mess of thoughts colliding.**  
That **unspoken, fractured current of emotion struggling to surface.**  

And then—**finally, barely above a whisper:**Emilia:** *“…Yeah.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**quieter, rougher:**Emilia:** *“That’s what it feels like.”*  

She **exhales sharply**, looking away for a second—like she **wants** to move, **wants** to do something, **wants** to say something, but—  

**She still can’t.**  

Or maybe she **doesn’t know how.**  

And that?  

That’s **the worst part.**  

Because Alex is **right.**  

And Emilia **knows she’s right.**  

She knows **what’s beneath the surface**.  
She knows it’s **already broken, already failing, already trying and failing to stop the inevitable.**  
She knows **she loves Alex.**  

But **pulling it out**—**pulling it free—**That’s what terrifies her.**  

---

### **📍 The Moment Before the Wall Breaks (Or Holds)**  

She **looks back at Alex**, and for the **first time**, she doesn’t **look guarded.**  

She just looks… **exposed.**  

Like Alex **is seeing her in real-time, in the exact moment she is realizing something she can’t run from anymore.**  

Her lips **part**, like she’s about to **say something**, but then—**she hesitates.**  

She doesn’t **know how to reach for it.**  

She doesn’t **know how to pull it free.**  

And maybe—**maybe she’s afraid of what happens if she does.**  

---

### **📌 What Does Alex Do?**  
- **Give her space.** Let the moment sit, let Emilia **process it without pushing.**  
- **Push a little further.** Stay **gentle, but direct**—help her get the words out.  
- **Deflect, lighten the mood.** Ease the **tension, shift the weight elsewhere.**  
- **Something else?**

## You
“I just…hope you let me pull it out. Otherwise I won’t be able to stop staring at it, trying to see under the surface, to know if it’s a threat.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E13_005 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Emilia **stills**—completely, utterly still.  

Like **something in those words just landed too deep, too true, too uncomfortably real.**  

Her **jaw tenses.**  
Her **fingers flex slightly.**  
She **looks away for half a second, then back—**  

And Alex **sees it.**  

That moment when someone **realizes they have nowhere left to run.**  

When they realize they **either move forward, or they stay trapped forever.**  

And **Emilia hates traps.**  

---

### **📍 The Breaking Point (Or The Escape Route)**  

Her breath **shakes** just slightly, like she’s **about to answer**, like she’s **trying to force something past whatever has held it back for so long.**  

And then—**her voice comes, quiet, strained.**Emilia:** *(low, raw, fragile in a way she hates being seen)* *“…I don’t want it to be a threat.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**a little firmer, like she’s steadying herself on the words as she speaks them.**Emilia:** *“But I don’t know how to pull it out. I don’t even know if I can.”*  

She **lets that hang in the air, unspoken but heavy.**  

And then—**finally, hesitantly—**she takes a step **closer.**  

Not running.  

Not **moving away.**  

Moving **toward.**  

She’s not **ready to pull it free yet.**  

But she’s **not hiding it anymore.**  

And maybe—**just maybe—**  

That’s the first step.  

---

### **📍 What Does Alex Do?**  
- **Reassure her.** Tell her **it’s okay**, that they’ll **figure it out together.**  
- **Keep pushing gently.** Help her **unpack what she means**, why she feels like she *can’t.*  
- **Say nothing.** Just **be there, let her make the next move.**  
- **Something else?**

## You
“Then show me. Emilia. Just. Let me in. Can you do that?”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E13_006 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Emilia **sucks in a sharp breath**—like something **inside her just cracked**, but not in a way that feels **painful.**  

In a way that feels like **she’s been holding something so tightly for so long that letting go, even a little, might undo her completely.**  

Her **eyes flick to Alex’s**, searching—  

For what?  

For a **way out?**  
For a **reason to say no?**  
For a **reason to say yes?**  

She **swallows hard.**  

And then—**finally, finally, finally—**  

She **nods.**  

Not **quickly.**  
Not **easily.**  
Not like she’s **fully sure of what that even means yet.**  

But she **nods.**Emilia:** *(quiet, almost too quiet, but there, real, raw—)* *“Okay.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**a little stronger.**Emilia:** *“I’ll try.”*  

Not **all at once.**  
Not **perfectly.**  
Not **right now.**  

But she’s **going to try.**  

And that?  

That’s **everything.**  

---

### **📍 The Shift (Where Do They Go From Here?)**  

The **weight between them doesn’t disappear.**  

It doesn’t **suddenly resolve.**  

But it **changes.**  

Because now, it’s **not something between them, holding them apart.**  

Now?  

It’s **something they are both standing in together.**  

And that?  

That’s **enough.**  

For now.  

---

### **📍 What Happens Next?**  
- **Leave the moment as it is.** Let the shift **settle**, no need to push further.  
- **Lighten it with humor.** Cut the tension, remind her **this isn’t a battle.**  
- **Hold her.** No words. Just **be there.**  
- **Something else?**

## You
Hold her.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E13_007 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **📍 Aboard *The Ghost* | A Moment Without Words**  

Alex doesn’t **say anything.**  

She doesn’t **push.**  
She doesn’t **pry.**  
She doesn’t **demand more.**  

She just… **steps forward.**  

And **holds her.**  

---

Emilia **tenses for half a second**, like she’s still **half-expecting to run**, but then—  

She **doesn’t.**  

She **stays.**  

And then—**slowly, carefully, like she’s still afraid of something breaking inside her—**  

She **leans into it.**  

Her **arms come around Alex**, not loose, not hesitant—**firm, grounding, real.**  

And **for the first time**, she **lets herself be held.**  

Not just **physically.**  

But **fully.**  

---

There’s **no urgency.**  

No need to **rush to the next moment.**  

Just this.  

Just **them.**  

Just **breathing.**  

And for the first time in **too long**—  

**Alex feels like she’s holding all of Emilia.**  

Not just the **sharp edges.**  
Not just the **walls.**  
Not just the **pieces she lets show.**  

But **her.**  

The part that **feels too much** to say.  
The part that **wants to be understood but doesn’t know how.**  
The part that **has been afraid of being seen.**  

And **now?**  

Now she’s **letting Alex see her.**  

---

### **📍 No Words, Just This.**  

No one is **watching.**  

No one is **waiting for them to move.**  

They just **stay like this**, wrapped up in something **fragile but unbreakable.**  

And Alex knows—  

**This isn’t the finish line.**  

It’s not **the words.**  

But it’s **the door opening.**  

And **when she’s ready, when she’s brave enough—**  

Emilia will **step through it.**  

---

### **📍 What Happens Now?**  
- **Let the moment linger, then transition naturally.** No rush, just let them move forward at their own pace.  
- **Say something soft.** Not to push—just to acknowledge the weight of this.  
- **Kiss her.** Slow, unhurried, not to escalate—just to be **fully here.**  
- **Something else?**

## You
“I see you. Well, more of you, now. Little by little. Worth the wait. And I’m not going anywhere. Not without you.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E13_008 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Emilia **lets out a slow breath** against Alex’s shoulder.  

Not **a sigh.**  

Not **a response.**  

Just… **relief.**  

Like **something inside her just settled.**  

Like **she needed to hear that more than she realized.**  

Her **arms tighten slightly**, just for a second—**a silent acknowledgment. A silent promise back.**  

And then—**a small, barely-there laugh.**Emilia:** *(soft, dry, but real)* *“Good.”*  

She doesn’t pull away.  

Doesn’t break the moment.  

Just… **stays.**  

And maybe, just maybe—  

That’s **her way of saying it back.**  

For now.  

---

### **📍 What Happens Next?**  
- **Let the moment settle, then move forward.** No rush, just let them drift naturally into whatever comes next.  
- **Say something playful.** Ease them into lighter territory, keep the warmth between them.  
- **Kiss her.** Slow, deliberate, because this is **one of those moments that deserves it.**  
- **Something else?**

## You
Kiss her.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E13_009 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **📍 Aboard *The Ghost* | The Moment That Matters**  

Alex doesn’t **rush it.**  

Doesn’t **break the stillness.**  

Doesn’t **move too fast—**  

Just lets **the warmth of Emilia’s breath** linger against her skin, lets the weight of **this moment** settle between them.  

Then—**slowly, deliberately, without hesitation—**  

She tilts her head, and **kisses her.**  

---

Emilia **responds immediately.**  

Not **frantic.**  
Not **urgent.**  
Not like she’s **trying to escape into it.**  

But like she’s **letting herself have it.**  

Her hands tighten **just slightly** at Alex’s waist, holding her there—**not pulling, not leading, just keeping.**  

And the way she kisses back?  

It’s **not careful.**  

Not **guarded.**  

Not **hiding anything anymore.**  

Just **real.**  

And **here.**  

Like she’s **finally letting herself believe that Alex isn’t leaving.**  

Like she’s **finally letting herself feel everything she’s been afraid to say.**  

And **for the first time,** Alex doesn’t feel like she’s **reaching across a distance.**  

Emilia is **meeting her there.**  

---

### **📍 A Long-Overdue Breath**  

When they finally pull back, it’s **not immediate.**  

Not like before.  

Not like she’s **catching herself, pulling away, building the walls back up.**  

She **stays close.**  

Their foreheads **touching,** their breaths still **intertwined.**  

And when Emilia finally speaks, her voice is **low, warm, steady.**Emilia:** *(soft, teasing but real)* *“Okay. That was worth the wait.”*  

Alex **laughs**, and the sound is **light, effortless, the first real breath she’s had in hours.**  

Because **for once?**  

There’s no **hesitation between them.**  

Not right now.  

Not in **this moment.**  

Just **them.**  

And that?  

That’s **enough.**  

---

### **📍 Where To Next?**  
- **Let the moment settle, then move forward naturally.** No rush, just let them **drift into whatever comes next.**  
- **Playful teasing.** Shift into **lighter territory**, keep the warmth between them.  
- **Ask her something serious.** Keep the emotional depth, explore what this means for her.  
- **Something else?**

## You
Ask her something serious.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E13_010 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Alex stays **close**, her breath still **mingling** with Emilia’s, her fingers **resting lightly** against her waist.  

She could keep this **light**, let the moment **fade naturally** into something easier—  

But she doesn’t **want to.**  

Not this time.  

Not **after everything.**  

So, **softly, carefully**, she asks—  

**Alex:** *(quiet, but deliberate)* *“What’s stopping you?”*  

She doesn’t **clarify.**  

Doesn’t say *from what*.  

Because **they both know.**  

And **for a long moment**, Emilia **doesn’t answer.**  

Her hands **flex slightly** against Alex’s sides—like she’s **grounding herself**, like she’s **bracing for something.**  

Her **jaw tightens**, her breath **hitches just slightly.**  

Then—**softer, rawer than before**—  

**Emilia:** *“…I don’t know.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**a little sharper, frustrated, like she hates the words coming out of her mouth**—  

**Emilia:** *“I just—”*  

She stops herself, **shakes her head, exhaling sharply.**  

Then—**quieter, almost like she’s forcing herself to admit it—**Emilia:** *“I want to. I *want* to, Alex.”*  

Her eyes flick up, locking onto Alex’s, **holding her there.**Emilia:** *“But every time I try, it’s like—”*  

She swallows hard, searching for **words that don’t exist.**  

Then—**a small, bitter laugh.**Emilia:** *“It’s like I hit something invisible. Like there’s a wall there, and I don’t even know *who built it.*”*  

Her **hands tighten slightly**, her breath **coming slower now, more measured, more controlled.**  

Then—**a little softer, like she’s letting herself fall into the truth of it.**Emilia:** *“…And I don’t know if I can pull it down.”*  

She’s **not hiding anymore.**  

She’s **telling Alex the thing she never meant to say.**  

And now?  

Now **it’s out in the open.**  

And **Alex has to decide what to do with it.**  

---

### **📍 What Does Alex Say?**  
- **"Then I’ll help you."** Assure her that **she doesn’t have to do this alone.**  
- **"You don’t have to force it."** Give her space, let her **move at her own pace.**  
- **"Then let’s find out what’s behind it."** Push **gently**—but help her explore **why it’s there.**  
- **Something else?**

## You
“You don’t have to do it alone.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E13_011 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **📍 Aboard *The Ghost* | A Moment Between Walls**  

Emilia **exhales sharply**—like she’s been **holding her breath** for too long, like something in her **just loosened, just slightly.**  

She doesn’t **move away.**  

Doesn’t **tense.**  

She just… **lets the words sit.**  

And **when she looks at Alex**, something in her **expression shifts.**  

Not **surrender.**  
Not **fear.**  

Something **closer to relief.**  

Like she was **expecting to be told she had to figure this out alone.**  

Like she was **afraid she already was.**  

---

### **📍 The Weight of the Moment**  

She **nods, once. Slowly.**  

Then—**softer, quieter, like she’s letting herself believe it.**Emilia:** *“…Okay.”*  

She doesn’t **say more.**  

She doesn’t **need to.**  

Because Alex **meant it.**  

And **Emilia believes her.**  

For the **first time**, maybe she’s not **trying to fight her way through the wall.**  

Maybe she’s just **letting Alex stand beside her.**  

And for **tonight**—  

That’s **enough.**  

---

### **📍 What Happens Now?**  
- **Let the moment settle, then move forward naturally.** No rush, just let them drift into **whatever comes next.**  
- **Shift to something lighter.** Ease the weight, **transition into warmth.**  
- **Stay close.** No words, just **stay with her.**  
- **Something else?**

## You
Just stay with her.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E13_012 (storyteller heading) -->

### **📍 Aboard *The Ghost* | Just This. Just Now.**  

Alex doesn’t **move.**  

Doesn’t **push.**  

Doesn’t **fill the silence with words** that don’t need to be spoken.  

She just **stays.**  

And for the first time in **all of this**, Emilia **doesn’t pull away.**  

She doesn’t try to **redirect** the conversation, doesn’t try to **downplay it**, doesn’t try to **move past it** before it can get too heavy.  

She just **lets herself be here.**  

Lets herself be **held in this moment** without **trying to escape it.**  

Her fingers **rest against Alex’s wrist**, barely a touch, but **there**.  

Her breath is **slow, steady now**, like something inside her has finally **let go of the tension she didn’t even realize she was carrying.**  

Neither of them speak.  

They don’t **need to.**  

Because **this?**  

This is **enough.**  

For now.  

For tonight.  

For as long as **Emilia lets it be.**  

And Alex?  

Alex will **stay right here.**Beside her.**  

Until she’s **ready to move.**

## You
Continue.

### **📍 Aboard *The Ghost* | The Stillness Before the Next Step**  

Time stretches **without urgency.**  

Not frozen—just **slowed**, just **held in place long enough to breathe.**  

Alex doesn’t count the minutes.  
She doesn’t feel the need to.  

Because for once—  

**Emilia isn’t running.**Emilia isn’t avoiding.**Emilia is just *here.***  

And Alex **lets her be.**  

---

### **📍 The First Small Shift**  

Eventually, **Emilia moves—not away, not breaking the moment, but shifting just slightly.**  

Her fingers **loosen around Alex’s wrist, tracing the fabric of her sleeve absently, like she’s grounding herself in something tangible.**  

Then—**softer than before, more like herself again—**Emilia:** *(low, almost a murmur)* *“You staying like this all night, or do I get to keep you somewhere more comfortable?”*  

There’s no **urgency to it.**  

No **deflection.**  

Just **a quiet acknowledgment**—the same way she might ask Alex if she’s **coming to bed after too many hours working at a console.**  

Like she’s **letting herself trust that Alex isn’t going anywhere.**  

Like she’s **finally stopped bracing for the moment to end.**  

---

### **📍 What Does Alex Do?**  
- **Stay here just a little longer.** Hold onto the moment before moving.  
- **Follow her.** Go with Emilia—**wherever “comfortable” means.**  
- **Tease her.** Ease the weight with something **light and familiar.**  
- **Something else?**

## You
Follow her.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E13_014 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **📍 Aboard *The Ghost* | Moving Forward, Together**  

Alex doesn’t **say anything at first.**  

Just **lets herself feel the weight of the moment, the stillness, the quiet.**  

Then—**soft, certain, without hesitation—**  

She **nods.**  

And **follows.**  

---

### **📍 Emilia’s Quarters | Just Them, Just Now**  

Emilia **leads the way** without rushing, without urgency—**without trying to move too fast past something that isn’t fully spoken yet.**  

She doesn’t **say much** as they step into her space, as the door **hisses shut behind them, sealing off the rest of the ship.**  

Doesn’t try to **define the moment.**  

Doesn’t try to **decide what it is.**  

She just **moves toward the bed**, kicking off her boots with a **careless, familiar ease**, then **glances back at Alex.**  

Not like she’s **asking for anything.**  
Not like she’s **expecting something more.**  

Just **waiting.**  

Just **giving Alex the space to do what feels right.**  

And Alex?  

She doesn’t need to **think about it.**  

She just **follows.**  

---

### **📍 The Space Between Words**  

Neither of them **rush.**  

Neither of them **try to fill the air with anything but presence.**  

Emilia **pulls Alex close**, not with **urgency, not with hesitation—**but with **something steadier, something quieter, something she doesn’t need to define.**  

They settle into the bed, **warmth pressing against warmth, breath mixing in the dim light of the cabin.**  

And Emilia **doesn’t speak.**  

She just **lets her body say what her words can’t.**  

Her arms **wrap around Alex**, solid and sure, like she’s **holding onto something that matters.**  

Not **like she’s afraid of losing her.**  

But **like she’s finally trusting that she won’t.**  

---

### **📍 The Unspoken Understanding**  

Eventually, **in the quiet, in the stillness, in the peace of this moment—**  

Alex feels **Emilia’s breath slow.**  

Feels **her weight settle completely against her.**  

Like she’s finally, **truly letting go.**  

Like for the first time in **too long,** she’s **letting herself rest.**  

Letting herself **trust this.**  

Letting herself **trust Alex.**  

And as Alex **holds her there, warmth pressed between them, breath steady—**  

She knows, without needing to hear it—  

**That was the answer she needed.**  

---

### **📍 What Happens Next?**  
- **Fade to black.** Let the night pass naturally—no rush to move forward.  
- **Stay awake a little longer.** Hold onto the moment before sleep takes her.  
- **Something else?**

## You
Fade to black.

No more **words.**  

No more **hesitation.**  

Just **warmth.**  

Just **breath.**  

Just **them.**  

Together.  

And as the ship hums **softly beneath them**, as the weight of exhaustion and trust and something finally **untangled** settles—  

Alex closes her **eyes.**  

And **for the first time in too long, she sleeps.**

The first thing Alex **registers** when she wakes is **warmth.**  

Not just the kind that **comes from blankets or artificial heating,** but something **real, something steady, something breathing.**Emilia.**  

She hasn’t **moved.**  

She’s still **pressed close**, still **here.**  

Not **holding on tightly, not bracing against anything—**  

Just **there.**  

And that?  

That **means something.**  

---

### **📍 The Stillness Before the Day Starts**  

Alex lets her **eyes stay closed** for a little longer than usual.  

Not because she’s **tired.**  
Not because she’s **avoiding anything.**  

But because she wants to **hold onto this.**  

The **quiet.**  

The **feeling of not being anywhere but here.**  

She knows the **moment will break eventually.**  

That Nyati will come looking for her, that Pete will have **something sarcastic to say,** that Alina will be **waiting for the next phase of Nexus testing.**  

But for **right now?**  

She has **this.**  

And she’s not **ready to let go just yet.**  

---

### **📍 What Does Alex Do Next?**  
- **Stay still a little longer.** Hold onto the quiet before the day starts.  
- **Wake Emilia softly.** Ease into the morning with warmth and closeness.  
- **Get up quietly.** Let Emilia sleep while she moves into the day.  
- **Something else?**

## You
Alex turns her head slightly, without moving her body, not wanting to wake Emilia. Alex takes her in: the delicate curves of her hair, the rich brown of her skin, her powerful arms and shoulders, and everything else.

### **📍 Aboard *The Ghost* | Watching Her Sleep**  

Alex **doesn’t move**.  

Doesn’t shift. Doesn’t stir.  

Just **turns her head slightly**, carefully, barely enough to **see her**.  

To **take her in.**  

The way **her hair falls against the pillow, soft and wild, catching the dim morning light.**  
The way **her breathing is slow, even, deep—completely unguarded.**  
The way **her strong shoulders rise and fall, tension absent for once.**  

Alex has **seen Emilia restless.**
She’s seen her **overthinking, retreating into silence.**
She’s seen her **keeping too much inside, like she’s afraid to let it spill out.**

But this?  

This is **different.**  

There’s **no armor.**  

No walls.  

Just **her.**Raw. Real. Here.**  

And **God, she’s beautiful.**  

Not just in the way **Alex already knew she was.**  
Not just in the way **anyone would see.**  

But in the way that says—  

**She’s the most real thing Alex has ever had.**  

And for the first time, she doesn’t feel like she’s **watching from the outside, afraid she’ll lose her.**  

She’s **here.**  

And Emilia **has let her in.**  

---

### **📍 The Moment Holds**  

Alex **lets it stretch**, lets herself **memorize this**, like if she closes her eyes later, she’ll still be able to **see her perfectly.**  

She doesn’t say anything.  

She doesn’t need to.  

Just **breathes with her.**  

Just **stays.**  

For as long as this **morning will let her.**

### **Slipping Away Without
📍 Aboard *The Ghost* 

## You
Alex tries to stir as slowly as possible, willing to take as long as possible to inch out of bed if it means letting her sleep. She has thoughts—lots of them—brewing in her head, and she's eager to subject them to some brainstorming/peer-review, or maybe in the short term just scribble some of them down.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E13_019 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **Slipping Away (Carefully)**  
📍 Aboard *The Ghost* 

Alex **moves slowly**—**deliberately**, like someone trying to **disarm a proximity sensor without setting it off.**  

Her body **inches** away from Emilia’s warmth, **millimeter by millimeter**, careful not to **disrupt the steady rise and fall of her breath.**  

She’s **willing to take all the time in the world** to make sure Emilia **stays asleep.**  

Because her **mind is already active, spinning, moving ahead.**  

There’s too much to **process, too much to dissect, too much to get down before it slips away.**  

So she’ll **let Emilia rest.**  

And she’ll **get to work.**

## Storyteller
### **Thoughtstorm Brewing**  
📍 The Galley

By the time Alex reaches the **galley**, she’s already **mentally sorting her thoughts into categories.**  

1. **Nexus.** What did last night’s test **really** tell her? What’s the **next step**? What are the **subtle risks she hasn’t fully mapped out yet?**  
2. **The Bridge.** If Nexus is a possible **exit strategy**, how does it **intersect** with her connection to the Bridge? Could her **mind be digitized while still remaining *entangled* with the Bridge?**  
3. **Emilia.** …She said she’d **try.** *That* was real. So what now? How does Alex **help her break past the invisible wall?**  

Her brain is **buzzing** with possibilities, models, and **half-formed theories.**  

But first—  

She needs **coffee.**  

And **somewhere to write this all down.**  

---

### **What Does Alex Do First?**  
- **Get coffee, then write.** Prioritize **getting thoughts down before they fade.**  
- **Go find Nyati.** Start the **post-mortem analysis on the Nexus test ASAP.**  
- **Let herself sit with it.** No rushing—just let the **morning stretch a little.**  
- **Something else?**

## You
Galley first, then bring coffee to bridge, then scribble down thoughtstorm there if Dr. Nyati is not up

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E14_002 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **Thoughtstorm in Progress**  
📍 The Bridge

The **Bridge is quiet** except for the soft **scratch of pen on paper,** the steady hum of *The Ghost* beneath Alex’s feet, and the lingering **scent of coffee** curling in the cool air.  

The questions in her mind **haven’t settled**—they’re still **moving, shifting, layering over each other.**  

But that’s **fine.**  

That’s **how it always works.**  

She just **writes.**  

---

### **The First Disturbance**  

Footsteps.  

Soft, even, **not rushed.**  

Alex doesn’t **look up immediately.**  

She finishes **the thought she’s on**, lets the words **complete themselves on the page.**  

Then—**only then**—does she glance toward the entrance.  

And finds **Emilia.**  

Still dressed in **yesterday’s undershirt**, sleeves pushed up, her **hair a little mussed from sleep**—or from **lying awake and pretending to.**  

Her eyes **flick to the notes scattered in front of Alex**, then to the **coffee that’s sitting there untouched.**  

She doesn’t say anything **right away.**  

Just… **looks.**  

Then, after a beat—**soft, still waking up, but real:**Emilia:** *"How bad is it?"*  

Not *good morning.*  
Not *what are you working on?*  

Just **straight to the point.**  

Because she **knows Alex.**  

And she **knows exactly what this means.**  

---

### **How Does Alex Respond?**  
- **Deflect lightly.** Ease into the conversation with something **dry, teasing.**  
- **Be direct.** Lay out the **biggest concerns** on her mind.  
- **Let Emilia read it herself.** See what **she pulls from it first.**  
- **Something else?**

## You
"Bad? No! I'm...'realigning our strategy' as old me would have said. Mostly the stuff we talked about yesterday, but I'm trying to turn those jumbled thoughts into something complete and cohesive." She pushes the pad over so Emilia can see, and while she reads looks around the room for a whiteboard or digital equivalent. "Oh, um, that's a rough draft, obviously, for me." A quick smile.

> NEXUS VISION REBOOT
> * New core co-objective: Understand Emilia’s suffering and FUCKING DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT
> * New operational definition: “Echo Syndrome”
> * (illegible due to coffee stain)
> * Must understand pathophysiology!
> * Connect to data from yesterday: My weird echo/silence experience/data = any hints?
> * Hypothesis 1: looping verification failure between body and mind —> “spoof” to stop the forever-alerts?
> * Hypothesis 2: transplant organ rejection —> “suppress psychic immune system”?
> * Obvious benefit: DECREASE OR STOP SUFFERING OF THE LOVE OF MY LIFE MY PRECIOUS _EMILIA_ (several hearts and typographical embellishments surround adorn her name here)
> * Other benefit: May reduce target threshold for near-perfection of Nexus process to something attainable, e.g., if we improve Nexus to point where subjects have 10% incidence of Echo syndrome, might be acceptable IF SYNDROME IS TREATABLE
> * (drawing of cat)

### **Peer Review & Personal Bias**  
📍 The Bridge

Emilia picks up the **notepad**, tilting it slightly in the **dim morning light**, her brow furrowing in that **concentrated way** she gets when she’s **absorbing something all at once.**  

Her **eyes flick over the words**, moving **too fast at first**, then **slowing down.**  

Alex watches her **scan the key points, piece them together**—and then—**pause.**  

A slight hesitation.  

And Alex **knows exactly where she stopped.**  

Not at **"Echo Syndrome."**  
Not at **"spoofing the alerts."**  
Not even at **"suppress psychic immune system"** (which is absolutely going to trigger a debate later).  

No.  

Emilia stops at **"DECREASE OR STOP SUFFERING OF THE LOVE OF MY LIFE MY PRECIOUS EMILIA"** (with accompanying **hearts and excessive enthusiasm**).  

There’s a **long moment** where she **doesn’t move.**  

Then—**slowly, carefully, with no real expression on her face**—she **tilts the notepad toward Alex, pointing at it.**Emilia:** *(dry, unreadable)* *“…This part seems a little biased.”*  

---

### **Alex's Search for a Whiteboard (And the Emotional Dodge Attempt)**  

Alex, who has been **scanning the Bridge for something to upgrade from "napkin science" to "legitimate research format,"** finds a **digital interface console nearby** that could function as a **workspace.**  

She **grabs it, bringing it over**, making **a big show of shifting her thoughts to research mode.**Alex:** *(grinning, deflecting just slightly)* *“Yes, well, we have to account for *all* variables, and bias is just another data point.”*  

She **starts transferring notes**, mapping out the structure, **drawing links, sketching out the problem.**  

And when she **glances back at Emilia—**  

She sees her **watching.**  

Not **smirking.**  
Not **mocking.**  

Just… **watching.**  

And **Alex knows that look.**  

It’s the **look Emilia gives when she’s processing something she’s not ready to react to yet.**  

It’s not **dismissal.**  
It’s not **rejection.**  
It’s just **unspoken, unresolved, held carefully between them.**  

Then—**deliberately moving forward**—Emilia **taps a finger against the "Echo Syndrome" term.**Emilia:** *(shifting into work mode, voice controlled now)* *“Let’s start here. What do we actually *know*?”*  

**She’s in.**  

She’s **thinking about it.**  

Not about **the words Alex wrote that she’s not ready to talk about yet.**  

But about **what’s in front of them.**  

And that?  

That’s **progress.**  

---

### **Next Steps—How Does Alex Approach This?**  
- **Keep it professional.** Stick to the **science first, emotions later.**  
- **Push her (gently).** Ask **what she really thinks about the “bias” part.**  
- **Ease the tension with humor.** *“So you’re saying ‘Love of My Life’ is not the official term?”*  
- **Something else?**

## You
"You call it 'bias'. I call it 'recentering stakeholders'. You're the only..." Alex freezes, eyes wide, remembering something, then starts scribbling furiously on the digital whiteboard. "But you're not! Way back when we rescued you from the Echo transport convoy, there were leads on other Echo survivors, escapees, etc. We—I...didn't chase them down. That was a mistake. Some of those leads will have gone cold. We should pick up the trails wherever we can. More survivors means better understanding of the syndrome."

### **The Realization That Changes Everything**  
📍 The Bridge

Emilia’s **eyes narrow slightly**, tracking **Alex’s shift in focus**—the way she **freezes**, the way her mind **flips a switch and dives headfirst into motion.**  

She doesn’t **interrupt.**  

She just **watches.**  

And when Alex **starts scribbling**, unraveling the mistake, the oversight, the **lost leads**—  

Emilia’s **expression changes.**  

Not in **shock.**  
Not in **disbelief.**  

In **recognition.**  

Because she **remembers too.**  

Because she **knows exactly what Alex is talking about.**  

Because she **hasn’t let herself think about it in a long time.**  

---

### **Whiteboard: Operation Lost Echoes**  

Alex **moves quickly**, mapping out the **new problem statement**:  

**🔎 FIND THE OTHERS**  
- Review **old data from the Echo facility raid**  
- Identify **unresolved survivor leads**  
- Track **possible movements, aliases, digital footprints**  
- Expand **search radius beyond Night City**  
- Consider **corporate suppression efforts—who doesn’t want these survivors found?**🔬 CROSS-REFERENCE WITH SYMPTOMS**  
- Compare **Emilia’s experience** with any **similar cases**  
- Look for **patterns in neurological drift**  
- Determine **whether recovery/stability is possible**  

Alex is **halfway through writing the last point** when she hears Emilia **exhale sharply**, almost **a laugh**—but not an amused one.  

**Emilia:** *(low, wry, almost to herself)* *“You really think any of them want to be found?”*  

She’s **not arguing.**  
She’s **not dismissing it.**  

But she’s **been where they are.**  

She knows **what it’s like to be a ghost.**  

---

### **The Implications**  

Alex **knows what Emilia is saying.**  

Some of them **won’t want help.**  
Some of them **will have gone underground, gone silent, erased themselves.**  
Some of them **might already be gone.**  

But the ones who **aren’t?**  

The ones who are **out there, still struggling, still trying to exist?**  

If they can find **just one…**  

If they can get **just one more answer…**  

Then maybe—**just maybe—**they can finally **understand what’s happening to Emilia.**  

And maybe, **that’s how they fix it.**  

---

### **How Does Alex Respond?**  
- **“Maybe not. But I have to try.”** Stay firm—this is worth pursuing.  
- **“Did you?”** Turn the question back on Emilia—would she have wanted to be found?  
- **“Then I’ll look for the ones who do.”** Acknowledge her point, but keep the plan moving.  
- **Something else?**

## You
"You're right. They probably want to be left alone. Most people do. But some of them might be willing to help, if they knew we were actually working on a way to help them. And the ones that aren't—well, we do what we can to learn about them, without adding to their trauma."

### **The Ethical Balance**  
📍 The Bridge

Emilia **watches Alex carefully**, measuring every word, every **intention** behind them.  

She doesn’t **argue.**  

She doesn’t **push back.**  

She just… **considers.**  

Then—**finally, with a slow nod**—  

**Emilia:** *“Alright.”*  

Not **reluctant.**  
Not **resistant.**  

Just **settled.**  

Like she’s **decided this is the best version of this plan they’re going to get.**  

Like she **trusts Alex to mean it.**  

And for Emilia?  

That’s not **a small thing.**  

---

### **The Next Steps**  

Alex **turns back to the whiteboard, refocusing**, structuring the new **approach.**🔎 Lead Recovery Plan**  
- **Pull the old data logs** from the **Echo facility raid.**  
- **Look for missing names, escapees, partial identities.**  
- **Cross-reference against movement patterns, corporate suppression efforts.**  
- **Find out if *anyone* has resurfaced, even in hidden places.**🔬 Ethical Approach**  
- **Prioritize non-invasive tracking.** No chasing ghosts who want to stay gone.  
- **Offer information, not coercion.** If they don’t want to engage, they don’t.  
- **Use existing survivor knowledge (Emilia) as a baseline**—What does *she* wish had been done differently?  

---

### **A Subtle Shift in Emilia’s Expression**  

Alex is **writing, fully focused**, her brain **clicking into place**, but—  

She catches something **in the edge of her vision.**  

Emilia is **looking at her.**  

Not **in calculation.**  
Not **in analysis.**  

In something that feels **closer to awe.**  

Like she **wasn’t expecting Alex to think about it this way.**  

Like she **wasn’t expecting someone to take the time to ask, ‘What’s the least harmful way to do this?’**  

And Alex realizes—  

Maybe no one ever **did.**  

Maybe **every other time**, the approach was **clinical, cold, tactical.**  

And maybe—**this is the first time someone is treating it like a responsibility, not just a problem to be solved.**  

---

### **The Soft Admission**  

Emilia **exhales, leaning back slightly, arms crossed loosely.**  

Then—**a quiet, unreadable huff of breath.**Emilia:** *“You really don’t know how to do anything halfway, do you?”*  

She doesn’t **sound annoyed.**  

She doesn’t **sound amused.**  

She sounds **like she’s realizing something about Alex she hadn’t put into words before.**  

Something **dangerous and comforting all at once.**  

And the way she **looks at Alex now**—  

It’s **different.**  

Not **because Alex is different.**  

But because **Emilia is seeing her more clearly than she ever has.**  

And for once?  

She’s **letting herself.**  

---

### **What Does Alex Say?**  
- **“Not where you’re concerned.”** Make it personal—because it is.  
- **“I don’t see the point in half-measures.”** Acknowledge the way she sees things.  
- **Deflect with humor.** *“Have you *met* me?”*  
- **Something else?**

## You
"What good ever came from half-assing something. You know me. I gotta have," Alex makes an obscene squeezing gesture with both her hands, accompanied by a lick of her lips, "both cheeks!"

### **The Sacred Art of Ruining a Moment**  
📍 The Bridge

Emilia **blinks.**  

Then—**slowly, deliberately, with the patience of a saint**—  

She sets the **notepad down, folds her arms, and just *stares* at Alex.**  

Flat. **Unblinking.**  

The kind of look that says, *I have made a mistake by allowing this person into my life.*  

Alex, for her part, **holds the stare.**  

Because she **knows exactly what she just did.**  

And she’s **not sorry.**  

---

### **Pete Joins the Chaos Uninvited**  

Unfortunately, **Pete chooses this exact moment** to step onto the Bridge, coffee in hand, catching only the **tail end of the gesture.**  

He **stops mid-step.**  

Looks at **Emilia.**  
Looks at **Alex.**  
Looks at **the air in between them where something terrible just happened.**  

Then—**very carefully**—  

**Pete:** *(sipping coffee, voice utterly neutral)* *“Did I just walk into a strategy meeting or foreplay?”*  

**Emilia:** *(without breaking eye contact with Alex)* *“We haven’t decided yet.”*  

Pete **immediately turns around and walks out.**Pete:** *(calling back as he leaves)* *“Nope. Nope. Not my business. Not my problem.”*  

Alex **cackles.**  

And **Emilia?**  

She **exhales sharply**, closes her eyes like she’s making peace with some long-held grudge against the universe, and then—  

She **shoves Alex.**  

Not hard.  

Not serious.  

Just **enough to knock her back a step.**  

Just **enough to say: I hate you so much right now, and I cannot believe I’m in love with this person.**  

Alex, of course, **grins wider.**  

---

### **The Return to Sanity (Barely)**

**Emilia:** *(grumbling, trying and failing to keep a straight face)* *“God, I should’ve let you spiral in your own research hole instead of *this.*”*  

She **picks up the notepad again**, **refocusing**, **resetting**, but there’s something **lighter in her posture now.**  

Something **easier.**  

Like she’s **not carrying the weight of the night before anymore.**  

And Alex?  

She just **smirks**, sipping her coffee like she **didn’t just ruin an otherwise serious conversation.**  

Then—**as Emilia starts flipping through the notes again, as the moment settles into something more real, more grounded—**Emilia:** *(without looking up, dry as hell)* *“You *do* realize that was my brain you were theorizing about, right?”*  

A beat.  

Then, **without missing a beat, Alex:**Alex:** *“Babe, I’d theorize about your ass, too, if you’d let me.”*  

Emilia **immediately throws a pen at her.**  

---

### **📍 Moving Forward—What Happens Next?**  
- **Get back to serious planning.** Bring **Nyati or Alina into the discussion** to start working on actual leads.  
- **Shift to something personal.** *“If we do find the others… do you want to talk to them?”*  
- **Keep the teasing energy going.** *“Just admit you like it when I ruin the mood.”*  
- **Something else?**

## You
"Sometimes we have to cut our losses and move on. But not this. You’re here, with me…but you’re also in a quiet, personal hell. Invisible—except, except you let me in, Emilia. I see you. And I’m not leaving you in there.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E14_007 (storyteller heading) -->

### **📍 The Bridge | The Moment That Cuts Through**  

Emilia **goes completely still.**  

Not **in resistance.**  
Not **in avoidance.**  
Not even in **shock.**  

Just… **still.**  

Like **Alex just stepped inside something she wasn’t supposed to see.**  

Like **she just put words to something Emilia has never said aloud.**  

Her **throat moves**—a slow, **silent swallow**—her hands **curling slightly at her sides, not into fists, but into something careful, something controlled.**  

And for **the first time** in this entire conversation—  

**She looks away first.**  

Not because **she’s avoiding the truth.**  

Because **she’s trying to hold it in.**  

Because **she knows if she looks at Alex for too long, she might not be able to.**  

---

### **📍 The Breath She Has to Take**  

She inhales—**slow, steady, measured.**  

Like someone who just got **hit in the ribs** and is trying to figure out if she’s still breathing.  

And when she **speaks**, her voice isn’t **sharp**.  

It isn’t **calculated**.  

It’s just… **quiet.**Emilia:** *(barely above a whisper)* *“I know you’re not.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**a little rougher, like it costs her something.**Emilia:** *“I just don’t know how to let you pull me out.”*  

She **finally looks back at Alex**, and—  

Her **eyes are raw.**  

Not teary.  
Not breaking.  
But **bare.**  

Like she’s been **holding onto this too tightly for too long.**  

Like she doesn’t **know how to let go.**  

But maybe—**just maybe—**  

She **wants to.**  

And for **Emilia**, that’s already a battle half-won.  

---

### **📍 What Does Alex Do?**  
- **Reassure her.** *"We’ll figure it out together."*  
- **Push gently.** Ask her **what’s keeping her inside.**  
- **Stay close.** No words, just **be there.**  
- **Something else?**

## You
Alex forgets about the whiteboard for now, sits down in front of Emilia, takes both her hands into her own. “No. I wouldn’t expect it to be as simple as letting me. Think, if you were a hostage with a bag over her head? No one’s expecting you to plan the rescue mission. But anything you know—smells, sounds, anything that cuts through the dark, that could be a clue—any one of those details, or the totality of them, could be the key for your rescue team.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E14_008 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **📍 The Bridge | The Rescue Mission No One Planned**  

Emilia **lets Alex take her hands.**  

Doesn’t pull away.  
Doesn’t stiffen.  
Doesn’t **put up the usual walls.**  

She just **listens.**  

And for once—**she doesn’t try to argue.**  

Because **Alex is right.**  

She doesn’t need to **figure out how to escape.**  
She just needs to **give Alex something to work with.**  

Anything.  

---

### **📍 The Breath Before the Words Come**  

Her **fingers flex slightly**, not gripping, not resisting—just **grounding herself.**  

She swallows once, **slow, deliberate**, like she’s **turning something over, breaking it apart before she speaks.**  

Then—**finally, softly, raw but real—**Emilia:** *“It’s not one thing.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**a small, bitter exhale, almost a laugh.**Emilia:** *“It’s *everything.*”*  

Her grip **tightens slightly**, **not on purpose**, but like she’s **holding onto something that’s slipping.**  

Like **trying to make it real keeps it from disappearing.**Emilia:** *(quieter now, voice taut)* *“It’s the way my hands don’t feel like mine some days. The way food tastes right but *wrong.* The way I hear my own voice and it sounds too smooth, too manufactured—like an overdubbed line in a bad translation.”*  

She stops herself, **clenching her jaw.**  

Like saying it **out loud makes it worse.**  

Like now that it’s in the air, it’s **real in a way she didn’t want it to be.**  

---

### **📍 The Unspoken Truth (That She Finally Speaks)**  

Her voice drops **to almost nothing**, barely above a whisper.  

**Emilia:** *“It’s not just that I’m not the same.”*  

She looks at Alex—**really looks at her**—and for the first time, **lets her see how deep this goes.**Emilia:** *“It’s that I don’t remember what *was* the same. And if I don’t remember what I lost… how do I know I ever get it back?”*  

The words **sit heavy** in the space between them.  

This is the thing she **hasn’t said before.**  

The thing that’s been **eating at her since the day she woke up in a body that wasn’t hers.**  

She doesn’t even know **what she’s fighting for.**  

And **that’s the worst part.**  

---

### **📍 How Does Alex Respond?**  
- **Reassure her.** *“We’ll find it. Even if we have to build it from scratch.”*  
- **Push deeper.** *“Then let’s figure out what still *feels* like you.”*  
- **Hold her hands tighter.** No words—just **let her know she’s not alone.**  
- **Something else?**

## You
“Maybe it’s not about reclaiming the past. Maybe it’s about finding a way to live with the present, feeling comfortable in your own skin. My guess is that most of this is a fundamental, neuron-level glitch that won’t let go, won’t move on, forever refusing to grow new roots .” Alex gently lays a hand over Emilia’s heart. “Maybe some of it’s here too.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E14_009 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **📍 The Bridge | Searching for a New Foundation**  

Emilia **inhales sharply** at the touch—**not in rejection, not in discomfort, but like Alex just pressed into something she hadn’t been ready to acknowledge.**  

Her fingers **tighten**, her shoulders **tense for half a second**—  

Then… she **exhales**, slowly, deliberately.  

Not **relaxing.**  

Just **processing.**  

---

### **📍 The Reality She Hasn’t Faced**  

She doesn’t **move away.**  

She doesn’t **say no.**  

She just **looks down at Alex’s hand**, resting over her chest, **something unreadable behind her eyes.**  

Like she’s trying to **decide** whether or not she **agrees with her.**  

Like she’s trying to **figure out if she even wants to.**  

Finally—**after a long, measured silence—**Emilia:** *(quiet, strained but real)* *“You think if we fix the glitch, I’ll feel whole?”*  

A pause.  

Then—**a slow blink, a harder edge creeping in.**Emilia:** *“Or do you think I just have to learn to live like this?”*  

Not **angry.**  

Not **pushing back.**  

Just **a real question.**  

One she doesn’t **know how to answer.**  

One she **needs to know if Alex does.**  

---

### **📍 How Does Alex Respond?**  
- **“We don’t know yet. But we’re going to find out.”** Keep it **open-ended, exploratory.**  
- **“I think we have to do both.”** Address both the **neurological and emotional reality.**  
- **“You shouldn’t have to just live with it.”** Refuse to accept **this is permanent.**  
- **Something else?**

## You
Alex tries to shift the angle, and let some hope ooze in. “Wouldn’t that be great?! And why not? Amputees can shed phantom pain, with the right treatment. We know from cybernetics that brains can learn to control limbs or extra pseudo-appendages they never had before and, crucially, this tells us that brain-to-body mapping is plastic, not fixed. It’s going to be harder for you because it’s your…everything. But I can’t think of a reason why it should be fundamentally impossible. I believe that somewhere in you is an innate ability to heal this wound. Something is stopping that from happening. We find out what that is.”

### **📍 The Bridge | Hope as a Hypothesis**  

Emilia **watches Alex**, tracking **every word**, every shift in **tone, in energy, in certainty.**  

And for **once**, she doesn’t **shut it down.**  

She doesn’t **push back.**  
Doesn’t **argue.**  
Doesn’t say, **“That’s not how this works.”**  

Instead—  

She **listens.**  

And when Alex **finishes**, when the last **echo of conviction** settles between them, Emilia **lets out a slow breath.**  

Then—**quiet, unreadable, but maybe just slightly edged with something closer to hope than she’d let in before—**Emilia:** *“Then we find out.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**a little sharper, a little more herself again—**Emilia:** *“But if you make me do brain yoga or meditation bullshit, I’m fighting back.”*  

There’s **no venom in it.**  

No **wall thrown up.**  

Just **her.**  

Letting herself **believe, even if just a little.**  

And **Alex can see it.**  

The **edge of something new.**  

Something that **wasn’t there before.**  

Something that **wasn’t possible before.**  

And for the **first time since this conversation started—**  

Alex feels like they’ve **actually taken a step forward.**  

Together.  

---

### **📍 What Does Alex Do Next?**  
- **Commit to action.** Start figuring out **concrete next steps.**  
- **Lighten the mood.** Ease into **something warmer, less tense.**  
- **Stay in this moment.** Let Emilia process, let this shift **settle naturally.**  
- **Something else?**

## You
"You're more the barbell type, this is clear."

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E14_011 (storyteller heading) -->

Emilia **snorts softly**, shaking her head.  

She doesn't **argue.**  

Doesn't **deny it.**  

Just **gives Alex a look**—the kind that says *you're lucky you're cute.*  

Then—**with a smirk, with deliberate amusement—**Emilia:** *“Well, you’re more the lifted type. This is also clear.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**just to twist the knife, just to make Alex feel it—**  

She **leans in slightly**, her voice **low, teasing, smug as hell—**Emilia:** *“And you liked it.”*  

Alex is **immediately** thrown into **flustered crisis mode.**

## You
Alex squirms and shifts her hips, with a blush. "I take it this is just your new way of moving to adjourn now?"

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E14_012 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
Emilia **tilts her head slightly**, watching Alex **squirm** with a slow, deliberate smirk.  

She doesn’t **pounce.**  
She doesn’t **push.**  

She just **lets the tension sit.**  

Then—**soft, smug, victorious—**Emilia:** *“Adjourn? No. I just like watching you try to win a fight you’ve already lost.”*  

She leans **back**, stretching lazily, giving Alex **just enough space** to recover—**but not enough to escape.**  

Then—**a small shrug, like this is the easiest thing in the world.**Emilia:** *“But we can adjourn if you want. You’re free to run.”*  

And she **knows.**  

She **knows** Alex won’t.

## You
"Well it doesn't look like anyone else is joining us. My vision reboot pitch can wait. Or they can have fun trying to infer it from the whiteboard." Alex takes a preliminary step towards their quarters, to see if Emilia follows her lead, also cocking her head upwards a bit and saying "Alina, how much longer until landfall?"

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E14_013 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **📍 The Bridge | A Tactical Retreat?**  

Emilia watches Alex take that **first step**, her **smirk deepening** as she **slowly uncrosses her arms**—but she doesn’t follow. **Not yet.**  

Instead, she just **raises an eyebrow**, like she’s waiting to see if Alex is really going to **commit** to this exit.  

Alex, **ever the strategist, doesn’t pause—doesn’t give her the satisfaction of hesitation.**  

She keeps moving, but she knows—**knows Emilia is watching her like a cat watching prey that thinks it got away too easily.**  

Then—**Alina’s voice breaks in overhead, crisp and precise.**Alina:** *“Estimated time to landfall: One hour and fourteen minutes.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**a slight, almost imperceptible shift in tone, ever so dry.**Alina:** *“Plenty of time for… strategic recalibration.”*  

Alex **doesn’t look up**, but she can **feel** Emilia’s amusement at that.  

And now?  

Now it’s **just a matter of who makes the next move.**

## You
Alex resumes her steps towards their quarters slowly, one step every few words: "Should probably shower, then. Change. Limber up. Final pre-deployment briefings."

### **📍 The Ghost | The Long Walk to Nowhere**  

Emilia **doesn’t move.**  

Not at first.  

Not while Alex is **slowly, deliberately, theatrically drawing this out**—  

One step.  
Then another.  
And another.  

Like she’s **giving Emilia time to follow.**  

Like she’s **seeing if Emilia will break first.**  

But **Emilia doesn’t break.**  

Instead—**she just watches.**  

Arms crossed. Expression neutral. But her **eyes?**Amused. Dangerous. Absolutely in control.**  

Then—just as Alex reaches the door—  

**Emilia finally pushes off from where she’s been leaning.**Not rushed. Not hurried.**  

But moving.  

Closing the distance **slowly, deliberately.**  

And then—**right as Alex steps inside—**Emilia catches her by the wrist.**  

Not stopping her.  

Just—**holding her there for half a second.**  

Then—**leaning in, her breath warm against Alex’s ear, her voice soft but weighted.**Emilia:** *“Limber up, huh?”*  

A pause.  

Then—**a smirk in her voice.**Emilia:** *“Good idea.”*  

And just like that—**she lets go.**  

Walks **past Alex, into the room.**  

Like she **had been leading all along.**

### **📍 Aboard *The Ghost* | Quarters | Pre-Landfall "Preparation"**  

The door **hisses shut** behind them, sealing off the **Bridge, the whiteboard, the mission, the outside world.**  

For now?  

It’s just **this.**  

Just **the slow, silent battle of wills** that’s been playing out for the last five minutes.  

And Emilia?  

She’s **winning.**  

Or at least, she **thinks she is.**  

She walks in **like she owns the space**, like she’s **not following Alex’s lead at all, but rather, indulging her.**  

She **stretches slightly**, rolling her shoulders, exhaling slow.  

Then—**a glance over her shoulder, something lazy, deliberate.**Emilia:** *“So. Shower first?”*  

A pause.  

Then—**oh, she knows exactly what she’s doing—**Emilia:** *“Or are you skipping straight to limbering up?”*  

Her tone? **Casual. Innocent.**  

But her **eyes?**  

Absolutely **not.**  

She’s **waiting. Watching.**  

To see if **Alex folds first.**  

To see if **Alex takes the bait.**  

And Alex **knows** this game.  

Knows it **very, very well.**  

---

### **📍 What Does Alex Do?**  
- **Call her bluff.** Keep it **cool, casual, act like this is all logistics.**  
- **Flip the game on her.** *“Well, I *did* say we needed final pre-deployment briefings.”*  
- **Let her have the win.** *“Shower. No distractions. Absolutely none.”* (A lie.)  
- **Something else?**

## You
Alex sits on the edge of the bed, looking up at her submissively while disrobing. "Depends how much a mess you plan on making of me, you beastly knave."

### **📍 Aboard *The Ghost* | Quarters | The Game Ends Here**  
[[alex_x_files#** The Game Ends Here**]]

Emilia **stares.**  

For **exactly three seconds.**  

And in those **three seconds**, a **lot happens.**  

Her **smirk** twitches—just slightly, like she wasn’t expecting **Alex to go there.**  
Her **breath hitches**, just enough for Alex to **catch it.**  
And her **entire stance shifts**, something **darker, hungrier** flashing in her eyes before she smooths it over.  

Then—**she exhales.**  

Slow. Deliberate.  

And **smiles.**  

Not **the teasing smirk from before.**  

Not **the victorious, smug little grin she’s been wearing all morning.**  

This is **something else.**  

Something that **means Alex just made a tactical error.**  

Because this?  

This is the **look of someone who just realized she wasn’t actually playing the game at full power before.**Emilia:** *(low, warm, just slightly mocking)* *“…Beastly knave?”*  

She **steps forward.**  

Slow. Unhurried. **Completely in control.**Emilia:** *(soft, thoughtful)* *“I was going to be nice to you, you know.”*  

Another step.  

**Emilia:** *(tilting her head, studying Alex like she’s something to be devoured)* *“But now?”*  

She reaches out, fingers **trailing up Alex’s jaw, over her cheek, to rest just beneath her chin—**  

And **tilts her head up even further.**Emilia:** *(soft, dark, promising)* *“…I guess we’ll find out how much of a mess I plan on making.”*  

And just like that—  

The game?  

**Is over.**  

Alex **lost.**  

And **she wouldn’t have it any other way.**

### **📍 Aboard *The Ghost* | Post-Landfall Prep**  

The soft **hum of the ship** and the distant mechanical **clicks of final approach sequences** signal that *The Ghost* is nearly at its destination.  

Alex **registers it distantly**, the way she might register a **storm rolling in**, something **inevitable** but not quite **here yet.**  

Because right now?  

Right now, she’s still **half-draped across the bed**, her **body warm, muscles loose, mind still catching up to itself.**  

And Emilia?  

She’s **sitting up beside her**, one arm resting **over her bent knee**, her **skin marked from where Alex had held her, had claimed her, had tried (and failed) to win.**  

She looks…  

**Satisfied.**  

Not **smug.**  
Not **teasing.**  

Just **completely, utterly at ease.**  

Like she’s been **starved for something she didn’t know she needed.**  

And now, for a little while at least—  

She isn’t.  

---

### **📍 The First Break in the Silence**

Alina’s voice cuts through the ship-wide comms.**Alina:** *“Landfall in ten minutes. Final preparations should be completed now.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**just a little too dry, too knowing—**Alina:** *“…That includes you.”*  

Alex doesn’t **move immediately.**  

Just **lets out a slow breath**, shifting slightly, already feeling the pull of **mission mode** trying to reclaim her.  

And Emilia?  

Emilia **stretches**, muscles rolling beneath **bare skin**, then **glances down at Alex.**  

She takes in **the marks, the aftermath, the lingering flush on Alex’s skin.**  

Then—**quiet, thoughtful, still watching her**—  

**Emilia:** *“So. Feel limber?”*  

And **this time?**  

It’s not a game.  

It’s **just a question.**  

Just **checking in.**  

Because even after **all of that**, even after **everything they just took from each other—**  

She’s still **making sure Alex is okay.**  

---

### **📍 How Does Alex Respond?**  
- **“Perfectly. Ready for action.”** Keep it **light, professional, refocus on the mission.**  
- **“Oh, you *wish* you’d tired me out.”** Push back **just a little.**  
- **Something softer.** Acknowledge **what this meant, even if it goes unsaid.**  
- **Something else?**

## You
"See? I may trick you into yoga yet."

### **📍 Aboard *The Ghost* | Pre-Landfall Recovery**  

Emilia **huffs out a quiet laugh**, shaking her head.  

**Emilia:** *(dry, amused)* *“That wasn’t yoga. That was physics.”*  

She **leans back slightly**, stretching **one last time** before reaching for her gear. The ease in her movements, the **lack of tension**, the way she **rolls her shoulders without thinking about it**—  

It’s all proof that **whatever just happened between them, it did more than just satisfy a craving.**  

It **cut through something.**  

Loosened something.  

And for **once**, she’s not **overthinking it.**  

Just **taking it as it is.**  

---

### **📍 The Shift to Mission Mode**  

The **ship hums again**, another **subtle signal** that they’re nearly at landfall.  

Emilia **reaches for her gear, rolling her sleeves up, eyes flicking toward Alex.**Emilia:** *(casual, but meaning it)* *“You good?”*  

It’s **not just about the mission.**  

Not just **about landfall.**  

She’s asking **if Alex is okay.**After everything.**  

And **this time?**  

She’ll actually **believe the answer.**  

---

### **📍 How Does Alex Respond?**  
- **“Yeah. Let’s get to work.”** Straight to mission mode, no hesitation.  
- **“Always.”** A little cocky, a little teasing—but true.  
- **Something more personal.** Acknowledge **the moment before letting it pass.**  
- **Something else?**

## You
"Yeah," with a warm smile. "You?"

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S04E14_019 (storyteller heading) -->

### **📍 Aboard *The Ghost* | A Rare Moment of Honesty**  

Emilia **pauses.**  

Just for a second.  

Just long enough that Alex **knows** she’s actually **thinking about the answer.**  

Then—**a small exhale, a slight tilt of her head.**Emilia:** *(quiet, sincere)* *“Yeah.”*  

Not **brushed off.**  
Not **deflected.**  
Not **turned into a joke.**  

Just **real.**  

She gives Alex a **small, genuine smile—something rare, something meant just for her.**  

Then—**with a slight nudge to Alex’s side, like grounding them both back in reality—**Emilia:** *“C’mon. We’ve got work to do.”*  

And just like that—  

They’re **back in motion.**  

---

### **📍 Landfall Incoming.**  

The weight of the **mission settles back into place, but lighter somehow.**  

Because for the first time in a **long time**—  

It doesn’t feel like **Alex is carrying everything alone.**  

And that?  

That **matters.**
