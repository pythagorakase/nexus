Just **a perch where you can see the first sparks fly.**  \n\nYou park in a **derelict parking structure** overlooking the **luxury capsule hotel** where your digital **ghost-self is supposedly holed up.** From here, you have **a clear sightline to the entrance, the security checkpoints, and—most importantly—the street.**  \n\nYour HUD runs a **passive scan.**  \n\n✔️ **Hotel security is on alert.** Extra guards at the doors, drones patrolling the balconies. **They think something’s up.**  \n✔️ **An unmarked AV (aerial vehicle) is holding position a block away.** Not a police unit. Not a normal corporate transport. **Could be an extraction team.**  \n✔️ **A Dynacorp response team just rolled up.** Black SUVs, armored, **four-man squad stepping out—tactical gear, silenced weapons.**  \n\n**You don’t stick around.**  \n\nThe moment you see **that much money moving, you know the deception worked.** Someone bought it—**or at least, they aren’t willing to take the risk that it’s fake.**  \n\nYou fire up the **Yamaha Ghost**, lean forward, and disappear into the city's veins.  \n\n---\n\n### **ANALYSIS: WHO BOUGHT THE LIE?**\n\n🟡 **If Dynacorp sent that response team,** that means they think you’re worth a **clean extraction.**  \n🟡 **If it’s a rival corp,** they’re moving in to either **grab you or kill you.**  \n🟡 **If it’s a third party,** then things are even murkier than you thought.  \n\nEither way? **They’re burning time, resources, and attention on a fake problem.** And that means **you just bought yourself a bigger head start.**  \n\n---\n\n### **FINAL MOVE: GETTING OFF THE GRID**\n\nThe city **fades in your mirrors** as you hit the **open road,** neon glow giving way to **cracked asphalt and dead highways.** The Badlands are ahead, and somewhere out there, **No-Name Pete is waiting.**  \n\nTime to see if he’s as crazy as they say.  \n\n---\n\n### **NEXT STOP: NO-NAME PETE** 🚀\n\n## You\nLet’s go!\n\n",

If anyone **physically shows up** to check the place, you’ll get their **faces, gear, and entry methods** on record.  \n\nThen you **cut the lights, grab the real data shard, and disappear.**  \n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Where to Run?**\n\nYour **safehouse is burned**, and you need a new place to **lay low while the decryption runs.**  \n\n#### **Options:**  \n\n✔️ **A Black-Market Netrunner Den** – A hidden basement in District 03, run by a **paranoid ex-corp tech named Bishop.** He won’t ask questions, but **he charges favors.**  \n\n✔️ **A Luxury Capsule Hotel** – High-security, corp-owned, but anonymous. If you can **spoof an ID**, you’ll be safe for the night.  \n\n✔️ **The Badlands** – Smugglers run **data havens outside city limits** where corporate eyes don’t reach. If you can make it out there, you’ll be **off the grid entirely.**  \n\n---\n\n### **What’s the next move?**\n\n## You\nOff the grid sounds attractive.

All unauthorized vehicles will be—\"**  \n\nYou kill the feed. **Wrong corps, wrong battlefield.** The past **lingers** out here, but you’ve got bigger problems.  \n\n---\n\n### **THE RENDEZVOUS**\n\nNo-Name Pete’s **coordinates** take you into an **abandoned missile silo**, buried deep in the desert. You follow an old **cracked service road**, headlights catching flashes of **old-world military wreckage—burned-out tanks, shredded VTOL husks, minefields that may or may not be dead.**  \n\nFinally, you hit **a chain-link gate**, reinforced with **rusted plating and solar panels.** The **sign on the fence is hand-painted, in red:**  \n\n**“NOTHING WORTH DYING FOR PAST THIS POINT.”**  \n\nYou cut the engine. The silence is **absolute.** Just the distant hum of **wind turbines** and the occasional **animal scream from somewhere too far to matter.**  \n\nThen—**movement.**  \n\nA turret **deploys from the sand**, old but **functional.** You hear **servo motors whine**, adjusting its aim **right at your head.**  \n\nThen, a **voice from the intercom:**  \n\n**\"If you're selling something, I don't want it. If you're lost, you're already dead. And if you're Corpo, you can fuck off right now.\"**  \n\nThat’s gotta be Pete.  \n\n**What’s your approach?**  \n\n1. **Go full tech-nerd.** You’ve got his cyberdeck, talk like you’re a fellow enthusiast.  \n2. **Be direct.** You have something he’ll want to see, and time is running out.  \n3. **Throw him off.** Tell him Dynacorp is already onto him—paranoia might make him listen.\n\n## You\nDoesn’t he know me? “Hey, it’s just me! You didn’t recognize me in my cool new nullcloak. I brought you a preeeeesent!” I slowly pull out the vintage deck.\n\n"

You sit with it for a moment—**letting it settle**—before finally turning to Pete.  \n\nHe’s been **quiet**, arms crossed, staring at the ground like he’s **trying to work out whether or not he wants to throw up.**  \n\nYou watch him for a beat, then gesture around the bunker. **“Alright, man. We’ve been unraveling my problems all night. Your turn.”**  \n\nPete **snorts**, running a hand over his shaved scalp. **“What, you wanna psychoanalyze *me* now?”**  \n\nYou **shrug.** **“Just realizing I don’t actually know shit about how you live out here.”**  \n\n---\n\n### **PETE'S LIFE IN THE BADLANDS**\n\nHe stretches, cracking his back, then **waves a hand around the bunker.** **“What’s there to know? I built a hole in the ground, stocked it with tech, and occasionally trade with people so I don’t die.”**  \n\n**\"Trade with who?\"**  \n\nHe **leans back against the workbench.**  \n\n✔ **Scavengers & Fixers** – People who **find old-world tech and need it repaired.** They bring him **pre-collapse processors, abandoned military gear, broken cyberdecks.** He fixes what he can, **keeps the good parts, sells the rest.**  \n✔ **Nomad Clans** – He’s **not one of them,** but he’s got **a few friendly contacts** in the drifting caravans. Sometimes they **bring him supplies in exchange for hacking jobs.**  \n✔ **Local Badlands Settlers** – Small pockets of people living **off-grid**, raising **livestock, growing food in biodomes.** Pete **doesn’t farm, but he knows people who do.**  \n\n---\n\n### **DOES PETE HAVE FAMILY?**\n\nHe **hesitates** at that one.  \n\nThen:  \n\n**\"Yeah. Had a family. Past tense.\"**  \n\nHe exhales, rubbing his temples.  \n\n**\"I was corporate once, same as you. A long time ago. But I had this little problem where I actually *gave a shit* about the people under me. Turns out, that’s not a great survival trait in the corporate world.”**  \n\nHe shakes his head.  \n\n**\"I stepped on the wrong toes, pissed off the wrong exec, and suddenly, *poof*—no pension, no severance, no future. My wife left before I even got my desk cleared out. I don’t blame her. She knew the score before I did.”**  \n\nA beat.  \n\n**\"My kid... he was too young to understand. I thought about reaching out once I got set up out here. But by then, I figured he was better off thinking I was dead.\"**  \n\n---\n\n### **THE KIND OF MAN PETE IS**\n\n✔ **Once corporate, but not built for it.** He had **empathy**—a **liability** in that world.  \n✔ **Lost everything and never tried to get it back.** Some part of him **thinks he deserved it.**  \n✔ **Still connected, but only at a distance.** Trades, barters, but **doesn’t let anyone get too close.**  \n\nYou watch him for a long moment, then **nod.**  \n\n**\"Sounds lonely as hell.\"**  \n\nHe **grins**, but there’s no humor in it.  \n\n**\"Yeah. But it beats getting stabbed in the back again.\"**  \n\n---\n\n### **NEXT MOVE?**\n\n1. **Tell him he’s full of shit.** He clearly still cares—he wouldn’t be helping you if he didn’t.  \n2. **Leave it alone.** You’re not here to fix Pete.  \n3. **Ask if he ever wants to see his kid again.** What would it take for him to reach out?\n\n## You\n1\n\n"
