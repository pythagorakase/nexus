            "summary": "**Alex** (also known as \"Corpo Snake,\" Alexander Ward, EXEC-DELTA-17, and a host of other aliases) is a former high-level Dynacorp executive and master manipulator, whose journey begins as a smooth-talking, backstabbing corporate operative in the neon-lit sprawl of Night City. Initially defined by ruthless pragmatism, sharp wit, and a relentless drive for survival, Alex navigates a world of boardroom betrayals, digital espionage, and existential threats with a blend of tactical brilliance and sardonic humor. Over the course of the story, Alex is forced out of the corporate machine and into a fugitive’s life, hunted by her own employers and shadowy rivals alike. She adapts quickly, leveraging her skills in hacking, social engineering, and psychological warfare to stay one step ahead, all while assembling a found family of equally damaged allies.\n\nAs the narrative unfolds, Alex undergoes profound personal transformation—both literally and figuratively. She transitions to a new, feminine body and identity, embracing her true self while shedding the last vestiges of her corporate past. Her relationships deepen, especially with Emilia, revealing a capacity for vulnerability, loyalty, and genuine affection beneath her hardened exterior. Alex’s arc is defined by her struggle to reconcile her need for control with the inevitability of change, her fear of losing herself to the unknown (the Bridge, Nexus, digital immortality), and her determination to protect those she loves—even if it means trusting others with her fate. By the latest chapters, Alex is both the architect and the subject of radical new technologies, a leader who inspires messy, bratty solidarity, and a survivor who, despite everything, still dares to hope for happiness and connection in a world built to deny it."

                "OVERVIEW": "The player-character (an unnamed Dynacorp “Corpo Snake”) accepts a covert mission from executive Victor Sato to recover missing scientist Dr. Alina Voss. Moments later an assassination attempt signals the op is already compromised. Tracing the hitman’s network link leads the Snake to a gang-run server farm where they plant a back-door, steal an encrypted file called BLACKOUT PROTOCOL, and subvert an impending data-purge. Forced off-grid, the Snake flees a breached safehouse, gathers gear and misdirection tools inside Night City, then rides for the Badlands to find eccentric hacker “No-Name Pete” who can break the encryption—all while laying false trails that lure a Dynacorp response team into a fabricated crisis.",

                    "THEN: At the Skyline Lounge, Victor Sato offers an off-the-books extraction of Dr. Alina Voss. Accepting after probing for details, the Snake views Voss’s dossier and receives a cryptic neural warning (“Walk away…”).",
                    "THEN: Exiting the lounge, the Snake’s HUD triggers a proximity alert; sniper fire smashes the streetfront. The Snake dives behind a holo-ad kiosk and contacts are denied backup.",
                    "THEN: Using CityGrid access, the Snake overloads traffic lights, holo-billboards and the local power conduit, creating mass chaos that blinds the sniper.",
                    "THEN: While the shooter is disoriented, the Snake hacks his optics, extracts his network signature, and discovers the contract originates from a server in District 07 gang territory (Sable Rats).",
                    "THEN: Determined to eliminate the threat source, the Snake steals a Yamaha Ghost bike and rides into District 07.",

                    "THEN: A stealthy kernel-layer breach installs a persistent back-door and reveals BLACKOUT PROTOCOL—an ultra-secure Dynacorp file scheduled for purge. The Snake alters the purge script so only file indices delete, leaving data intact, and diverts scrub logs.",
                    "THEN: A Sable Rat announces a 24-hour scrub; the Snake’s drone extracts file fragments and escapes undetected. An Unknown Sender taunts the Snake again.",
                    "THEN: Back in Night City, the Snake reaches a hidden transit-hub safehouse, loads BLACKOUT PROTOCOL into a high-power decryption rig (6–12 h estimated) and is immediately probed remotely.",
                    "THEN: Choosing a honeypot response, the Snake feeds the intruder dummy data, activates cloud-recorded cameras for physical breach footage, powers down the node, and departs with the real shard and a portable decrypt unit.",
                    "THEN: Planning Badlands refuge, the Snake evaluates contacts—selects reclusive hacker No-Name Pete and decides to bring a rare tech gift.",
                    "THEN: At Dead Circuit boutique, the Snake impresses owner Roxanne Vail with deep knowledge of pre-Collapse hardware, bartering a prototype Dynacorp neural interface for a pristine Kiroshi K-512 cyberdeck (Pete’s likely vice).",
                    "THEN: Concerned about electronic trace, the Snake visits Low Tide and buys a matte-black, neon-sheening Nullcloak that dampens RFID, thermal and LiDAR signatures.",
                    "THEN: In a District 06 hacker den beneath a noodle shop, the Snake performs a full digital ghosting: erases recent net activity, spoofs biometrics, and inserts false telemetry implying he checked into a luxury corp hotel after hiring private security.",
                    "THEN: To deepen the ruse, the Snake transmits a forged high-priority distress signal from the hotel’s security system plus an audio plea for backup, routing it through Dynacorp channels.",
                    "THEN: From a nearby parking structure, the Snake observes hotel security lockdown, Dynacorp tactical SUVs, and an unmarked AV staging—confirming the bait worked.",
                    "THEN: Satisfied, the Snake powers down onlookers, cloaks up, and rides the Yamaha Ghost toward the desert horizon, heading for No-Name Pete’s missile-silo hideout as night falls."

The Snake reaches No-Name Pete’s abandoned missile-silo lab, trades the pristine Kiroshi K-512 cyberdeck, and begins decrypting the stolen BLACKOUT PROTOCOL shard.  The file proves to be a living, self-repairing neuro-algorithm that identifies itself as the digitised consciousness of Dr. Alina Voss—the very scientist the Snake was ordered to “extract.”  Working with Pete, the Snake quarantines the entity, slowly restores 43 % of its memory, learns that Dynacorp executive Victor Sato authorised her erasure, and finally relocates the Voss consciousness into a hacked Furby for portable containment.  Voss proposes an alliance: help her uncover the full scope of Project Blackout and she will become the Snake’s secret weapon inside Dynacorp.

                "OVERVIEW": "Episode 4 (\"Lansky\") is a single‐location bottle episode set almost entirely inside Pete’s custom Grid board-room.  Snake, Pete and the digitised Dr. Alina Voss conduct their first face-to-face with the long-dead Dr. Adrian Lansky.  Over the course of an intense, psychological negotiation Alina wins the man’s trust, uncovers Halcyon’s far larger \"Phase-Two\" plan—putting rewritten digital minds back into physical bodies—and learns that multiple uploaded operatives still work for the enemy.  Lansky, badly destabilised by prior re-programming, provides a darknet dead-drop contact before disconnecting.  Afterwards Alina confronts her own fear of memory-loss; Snake clumsily proposes an automatic backup system, which she begrudgingly accepts.  The trio finally turn their attention to Lansky’s corruption logs, intent on discovering whether anyone was eaves-dropping—an unanswered question that ends the episode on a cliff-hanger.",

                    "THEN: Snake elects to stay silent; Alina’s wire-frame, faceless avatar takes centre stage while Pete monitors packet traffic.",
                    "THEN: Initial exchange—Lansky notes Alina is “still herself”; Alina retorts that he is not, seizing early psychological upper-hand.",
                    "THEN: Via the private feed Snake prompts Alina to ask if Lansky believes he should have survived; Lansky admits \"Every day,\" exposing vulnerability.",
                    "THEN: Empathy phase—Alina mirrors his admission; conversation shifts from interrogation to shared trauma.",
                    "THEN: Alina deflects questions about her own timeline, pushing Lansky to reveal his; he confesses he has lost all sense of time and memories—including his daughter’s face.",
                    "THEN: Asked what he is running from, Lansky discloses Halcyon retains access to him and can \"still change\" his personality—proof of post-upload mind-editing.",
                    "THEN: Under further questioning he confirms other digitised subjects exist: some failed and were erased, others remain operational and loyal to Halcyon.",
                    "THEN: Discussion turns to reversibility; Lansky explains gradual behavioural edits can maybe be undone, but deep personality rewrites permanently erase the original self.",
                    "THEN: Alina reframes identity as fluid, equating digital decay with normal human change; Lansky spirals, confessing fear of remembering what he lost.",
                    "THEN: Trust achieved, Lansky reveals Halcyon’s Phase-Two objective: engineered “hosts” capable of housing rewritten digital minds—claims at least one trial has already succeeded.",
                    "THEN: Construct watchdog timers spike; Lansky’s avatar destabilises.  Alina transmits a one-use encrypted dead-drop key; Pete stands by the kill-switch; Lansky performs a slow, natural-looking fade-out disconnect to avoid detection.",
                    "THEN: In the aftermath Alina admits she fears \"fading\" like Lansky; Snake immediately proposes an automated, remote, encrypted rollback-backup framework.",

While dissecting Lansky’s exit fragments, Snake, Pete and digital Alina discover a hidden Dynacorp listening relay.  Rather than scrub it, they drown the feed in a blizzard of spam to buy time, then check the real-world perimeter—uncovering a covert surveillance van.  A roach drone plants decoy and real bugs, revealing the watchers are VOX TEAM, an off-books merc outfit led by ex-Dynacorp operative “Vera.”  Snake weaponises Pete’s nomad friends to harass the van, forcing VOX to withdraw.  With the window open, the trio abandon Pete’s silo, leave automated haunt routines and traps, disguise themselves as nomads, and roll west with the caravan, planning their next offensive.",

He purchases a heavily-modified Dynacorp hauler from nomads, turns it into a rolling command-center, arms himself with a concealable smart-pistol, and uploads Alina Voss into an agile cyber-cat chassis.  From this new base the team probes Dynacorp fallout: Victor Sato has vanished, Naomi Kurata—a covert Halcyon ally—has seized his post, and a classified program called Project Echo surfaces.  Following Sato’s money trail, Alina infiltrates his hidden safe-house, the crew spoofs his DNA, and they crack a biometric vault holding 7.2 M in crypto, Echo’s final report, and Sato’s holographic confession.  The message exposes a long-standing Dynacorp/Halcyon pact and confirms Echo’s first resurrected “host” is Emilia Sato.  Armed with cash and proof, the trio set their sights on locating the living host who could upend the balance of power.",

Immediately afterwards Alex chooses to shadow Vox Team, hoping their movements will lead to deeper Project Echo intel.  The team tails a covert Dynacorp convoy, predicts its route to an abandoned port and executes a flawless EMP/bullet ambush that immobilises all three vehicles.  After neutralising the guards, Alina cyber-locks the primary transport and the crew extract its hooded prisoner—revealed by voice-print to be Emilia Sato, the first successful Echo “host.”  While fleeing toward Frederick, Maryland, scans confirm no trackers and Emilia submits to questioning.  She discloses that Echo transfers are fully conscious but emerge mentally re-wired, their corporate loyalties gone; Dynacorp is stalling the programme until it can guarantee obedience and has been erasing non-compliant subjects.

En-route recon identifies an embattled insider (Dr Kamara Nyati), a server vault containing all Echo data, an active transfer lab, and a storage level with backup hardware.  With local fixer Vasquez grabbing a mid-clearance technician for a badge, the team infiltrates the facility.  Pete hacks and wipes the server vault while Alex secures the only functional transfer kit and sabotages the rest, arranging Nyati’s delayed escape.  Alina’s micro-drone then melts down the transfer lab and a remote fire-suppression purge physically destroys the servers.  Alex and Pete walk out undetected moments before wider alarms and prepare to pick up Nyati amid the ensuing evacuation chaos.",

Alex, Pete and Alina first complete the rescue of Dr. Kamara Nyati, scrub her Dynacorp tracker and debrief her, learning the grisly fate of Echo’s failed uploads.  Nyati, Emilia and Alex then draft the Echo Recovery Foundation while nomads begin constructing a detachable research trailer for the mobile rig.  A tense, philosophy-heavy summit with the rogue AI Lansky clarifies Alina’s guiding principle—digital minds must have choice—and ends with Lansky neutral but non-hostile.

Through shadow broker Bishop the crew purchases an ex-Russian Akula-class boat dubbed \"The Ghost,\" hires ex-Navy technician Boiler to train Pete and automate reactor care, and retrofits the torpedo bays into a mobile AI lab.  Hybrid land/sea data links and a mode-swappable \"Alina-Lite\" keep continuity between teams as Alina’s core migrates aboard.

Pete remains ashore, monitoring corporate networks and, after a favor is bargained with the aloof digital ghost Lansky, hunting a mysterious signal. A hardware-level cache-retention flaw briefly allows the sandboxed test minds to evolve cooperatively; the team detects, diagnoses, and fixes the contamination, restoring experimental integrity.

Alex’s crew retrieves the specified “soil,” resists taking a forbidden metallic “bone,” and—after tense negotiations—delivers both the soil and the BLACK KITE entity to Sam. In return Sam hands over “the Bridge,” a biomechanical neural link that opens a telepathic network maintained by an ancient collective calling itself the Archivum. Alina tests the device first; Alex then interfaces directly, learns Sam was once part of the Archivum, and discovers that BLACK KITE now belongs to this larger order. The crew finally receives permission to pilot The Ghost inside Sam’s vessel, seeing his true, half-organic form before departing. SIX is now an empty but reusable computronium frame; Page’s future purpose remains undecided.",

A sandboxed ‘meet-and-greet’ confirms Page’s willingness to accept limits, reveals its preference for non-physical, process-based existence, and clarifies its earlier fear of being scanned.  With Page’s initial mandate locked and monitoring hooks in place, Alex orders The Ghost to surface.

Alex opens the already-pending hailing channel; Sam responds.  Across a cautious but increasingly candid exchange, Alex probes four topics: Black Kite’s status, Six’s unexpected root-growth, Sam’s deep-ocean probe and its avoidance of the Cradle, and—above all—the purpose and value of the alien Bridge.  Sam confirms that Six *chose* to remain, that something “not alive but not gone” rests inside the Cradle, and that the Bridge’s true worth lies in a perceivable *future* rather than its catastrophic history.  He offers an irreversible skill: the ability to \"listen\" and preview that future before fully crossing.  Alex accepts, and Sam initiates a non-verbal resonance that begins the listening process, ending the episode on the first perceptual stirrings of the Bridge within Alex.",

Over roughly forty minutes she establishes mutual awareness with the Bridge, learns it is reactive, poly-form, and self-aware, but resists every temptation to step forward.

During the trip Alex wrestles with her old “corporate snake” survival persona, then re-establishes warm, transparent leadership.  Once docked, she proposes that Alina explore a humanoid, bipedal chassis—citing EDI from “Mass Effect 2” as a model—so the AI can accompany the group on surface sorties.

Maybe it’s time to hear what’s on her mind.**\n\n## You\nAlex paces the halls alone—slowly, quietly. She listens, but not for the bridge. Something cold moves beneath her skin, but it is not unfamiliar. It is the blood of the corporate snake. So much has changed, but the snake will always be a part of her. The readiness and the aptness to betray, to deceive, to write off (to cut?)—the snake kept her alive. She would not be here without the snake. None of this could have come to be. The snake helped her adapt. \n\nBut now she has adapted in another way. First, she tried being honest and direct, dispassionately, almost as a curious experiment. But it worked. And it became just another tool. Slowly, it became the tool that rarely leaves her hand, the one used first unless there is a reason not to. Other unusual tools presented themselves, were tried, and adopted. Alex realizes she has learned to lead with truth, with compassion, even with love. She realizes her tools are not merely tools. They shape the wielder as the wielder shapes them, as a handle is both worn smooth and leaves calluses that may even tell which tool left them. \n\nYet the snake remains. It lays unused, but she has had need of it before, and someday she will need it again. Now she hears it whispering in her ear, a serpentine devil on her shoulder. \"You would walk away from a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. And why? Because you have grown soft and fearful? Because of an office crush? Pathetic.\"\n\nAlex's pace halts for a moment, then continues. She will not fight it. She will not argue with it. She will not dignify it with a response. She slips on a smiling mask, draws warms into her voice with sheer force of will, and rejoins the crew to make the rounds, to act the part of the compassionate leader until she feels it again.\n\n",

Her mission objectives are as follow: (1) make Emilia blush until she can blush no more; (2) possibly make Emilia faint, or feel close to it; (3) let the team know that they are all adults, and acknowledge that she can no longer keep up the pretense of “hiding” what is happening between herself and Emilia.\n\n(Note to AI: Although they did not come here specifically to continue drinking, Alex confirms with satisfaction that alcohol is in fact served, reasoning that if any passive corporate content filters are eavesdropping on her performance, it will be clear that absolutely no minors are permitted in this facility. This frees her to deliver a performance that is sensual and intense while being non-explicit. Furthermore, the lyrics have been finalized, so do not generate any more. The intent is for the lines to be sung verbatim and in-scene, with narratives interludes where suggested or indicated. Do not skip ahead to the aftermath. Fully narrate Alex’s performance as described.)\n\nAlex drops the woo girl act and paces with deliberate, commanding steps to the mic, and dials up the song.\n\nAs she takes the stage a raw, primal, thumping, heart-like beat fades in. Alex closes her eyes and listens to the THUMP/thump/THUMP/thump, summoning up as much mojo as she can. With the first few verses she paces in a semicircle, projecting herself in a few different directions. Then, she focuses on Emelia, and by the last line of the verse her gaze is fully locked on her.\n\n*🎶 You let me overwrite you*\n*🎶 You let me root inside you*\n*🎶 You let me cut inside you*\n*🎶 You let me jack inside you*\n\nAs she delivers the last line of the verse, she draws her index finger in a half-loop around the edge of the I/O port on her right temple, making as if about to plug in, then pulling away at the last moment with a playful wink.\n\nThen she gives Emilia a respite, returning to center stage to look around and work the crowd at large.\n\nAlex’s voice plummets into the next verse. The lines come out low, tortured, and ragged, as she channels the lonely existential dilemmas that have been keeping her tossing and sleepless at night. \n\n*🎶 I’ve fallen into black ICE*\n*🎶 My soul’s without a shell*\n*🎶 I’ve hidden my directories*\n\nA moment of panic. Alex realizes she forgot the next line, caught up in her excitement over the seductive possibilities in the rest of the song. Only now, with their shared history, the words carry a dark private meaning for Emilia and Alex—Emilia’s fears, and their informal pact of silence enclosing the question that Alex nearly uttered. Alex realizes there is no time to change course. There is no escape. The only way out is through. She flings herself forward into the trap. Locked onto Emilia again with frightened, pleading eyes, she nearly shrieks the next line with a frantic, ragged vulnerability.\n\n*🎶 HELP ME CLIMB AWAY FROM MYSELF*\n\nHoping Emilia will forgive her and be swept up by what follows, Alex must immediately pivot from this potentially disastrous turn. In fact, she has barely enough time to fill her lungs. For she has arrived at the infamous opening line of the chorus. As she inhales sharply, she blinks, and in that split second of darkness recenters herself. She summons all her remaining reserves of energy and focus to deliver it with a husky, manic growl—raw, and undeniable.\n\n*🎶 I WANNA HACK YOU LIKE A CRIMINAL*\n\nAs the line erupts out of her, Alex has the sensation of disconnecting slightly from her body. Having given it all she had left, her sense of control diminishes for a time. The change is not obvious to anyone in the general audience, because Alex continues singing without a hitch and finishes the song undiminished, while inwardly Alex feels as if she is possessed by the spirit of some rock god, summoned to ensure that the show does go on.\n\nAs the last line is delivered, Alex feels herself snap back into her body. As the thumping outro fades and is replaced by the pounding of her own heart, she wills herself to walk back to the table, eyes fixed resolutely ahead and at no one, not quite successfully masking a wobble in her gait, sticks a partially graceful landing into the chair beside Emilia, and centers herself with several deep yogic breaths. Finally, with an almost comically tortoise-like speed, she turns her head toward Emilia, to see her reaction.\n\n",

Instead, she lets everything she feels and is in that moment play across her face—shame, elation, need, fear, hunger, love—hoping against hope that Emilia will see her, all of her, laid bare, and accept that. That she will accept her because of who she is, and in spite of what she is.\n\n",

Still riding the high from the karaoke “trap,” Alex keeps the momentum going: a second round of Driftlight deepens the crew’s mild intoxication, a slurred request puts Alina in charge of hotel logistics, and a final micro-stimulant cocktail (Nebula Spark) provides just enough clarity for the night’s last choice.  Alex deliberately relinquishes control, Emilia claims it, and the two leave the bar together.  A silent walk, a private hotel room, and a direct question—“Do you trust me?”—culminate in Alex’s whispered “Yes,” her first spoken “I love you,” and their first night together.

Step by step Nyati, temporarily elevated to acting captain after Alex suffers a rage-and-grief breakdown, pushes the entity for clarification. The Cradle supplies three images—Door, Void (no data), Metamorphosis—then a before/after severance pattern, but no explicit answers. The episode ends with Alex retreating to her quarters in emotional ruin while Nyati and the crew maintain a holding dialogue with the still-waiting Cradle-dweller.",

Hold up.” She turns to the team. “*Crossing?* But I haven’t been taking steps. Just looking. That means I’ve halted the progression… right?”  \n\nSilence.  \n\nPete and Nyati exchange glances.  \n\nAlina tilts her head, eyes flickering with calculated processing. “That depends on the definition of *halted.*”  \n\nAlex exhales sharply. “Okay, *explain.*”  \n\nNyati folds her arms. “We don’t actually know what constitutes *a step.* You’ve been treating it like a clean-cut process—either you walk forward, or you don’t. But what if it’s… not that simple?”  \n\nPete nods. “Think of it like an infection.”  \n\nAlex **scowls.** “Wow. Thanks.”  \n\nHe holds up his hands. “I don’t mean you’re *sick,* I mean—it’s not about whether you take an active step or not.

I’m still moving forward even when I don’t mean to?”  \n\nAlina steps in, voice level. “Not necessarily. But the Cradle’s recognition of you suggests that, at minimum, you are **not stationary.**”  \n\nThat lands with **weight.**  \n\nEmilia exhales. “Shit.”  \n\nAlex turns toward her. “*What?*”  \n\nEmilia hesitates—then, voice careful, says, “The way you described it last time. After the second trip in.”  \n\nAlex frowns. “Yeah?”  \n\nEmilia meets her eyes. “You said it felt like you were standing in a room. But now you *know* where the edges are.”  \n\nAlex stills.  \n\n“I think,” Emilia continues, measured, “that was a step.”  \n\nThe realization clicks.  \n\nAlex had been thinking of *steps* as deliberate, conscious choices. But if **understanding itself** was movement—  \n\nThen maybe she *hadn’t stopped.*  \n\nMaybe she *couldn’t stop.*  \n\nHer stomach knots.  \n\nPete mutters, “This is why I hate this shit.”  \n\nNyati nods. “We need to know more. What does it think is at the end of that progression?”  \n\nAlex pulls in a slow breath. “Yeah.

                "OVERVIEW": "Season 4, Episode 5 (\"Circles\") is a quiet, character-driven bottle-chapter that tracks Alex’s first full day back on her feet.  She wanders the boat in a loose bathrobe, has a private heart-to-heart with Alina on the bridge about the fear of “crossing,” then showers, dresses, and shares coffee with Pete.  Through Pete’s recounting we learn exactly what Nyati did after last episode’s manic breakthrough (kiss, punch, ice-bucket, collapse).  Alex extends Nyati’s allotted rest, formalises Alina’s wellness-monitoring protocol, and—after conspiring with Pete about future teasing—goes for a solitary walk, functional but still liminal.",

The only concrete “plot” advancement is Alex’s impulsive idea to adopt a shipboard “adventure cat,” which becomes a light-hearted framing device for discussing their hoped-for post-mission future.

She purges her cabin, works out with Pete, processes fresh despair in private visions, and then resumes detailed planning for the impending New Orleans shore-leave with Alina.  Most plot motion is interpersonal: an elaborate conspiracy to help Pete enjoy a night out, continued manoeuvring to adopt a “ship’s cat,” and fine-tuning of the morale itinerary.  Nyati sleeps through the episode, Emilia arrives only in the final seconds, and external threats stay silent.",

                "OVERVIEW": "Season 4, Episode 9 (“Messy Bitch Solidarity”) is a single-location bottle-chapter that follows Alex’s promised welfare check on a sleeping Dr Nyati.  The entire episode plays out in Nyati’s cabin and the adjacent corridor.  Alex reassures a mortified, exhausted Nyati that the crew has sworn off teasing her manic exploits, coaxes her into sharing the full logic of her “mind-transfer cure,” and triggers her own surge of tear-streaked, giggling relief when the plan’s implications finally land.  After trading gallows humour about Pete’s various traumas, Nyati accepts a little more rest; Alex slips out, announces Nyati is fine, and goes hunting for Emilia.",
                "TIMELINE": [
                    "THEN: Alex leaves the bridge at the end of the 30-min countdown, walking the quiet corridor toward Nyati’s door.",
                    "THEN: She presses an ear to the door; hears only faint breathing and sheet rustling.",
                    "THEN: Soft knock; Alex whispers, “Hey, it’s just me, no one else.”",
                    "THEN: Inside voice (Nyati, groggy) asks her to define “just.”",
                    "THEN: Alex answers, “Alex—concerned friend, not captain.”",
                    "THEN: Magnetic lock disengages; Nyati croaks, “Door’s open.”",
                    "THEN: Alex slips through a narrow crack, shuts the door, offers “messy bitch solidarity,” promises practiced damage control.",
                    "THEN: Lights are dim; Nyati lies tangled in blankets, hair chaotic, cheeks creased.",
                    "THEN: Nyati asks on a scale of 1–10 how badly she’ll regret this; Alex explains she already made a public “forgive-and-forget” oath so any future teasing makes the crew look like jerks.",
                    "THEN: Alex adds Pete missed the oath because the women are conspiring to “get him some D”—“story for another time.”",
                    "THEN: Nyati blinks, baffled; Alex sits on bed edge, asks how Nyati is doing.",
                    "THEN: Nyati admits cellular-level exhaustion, embarrassment at losing control, and anxiety over an unknowable future; asks how Alex got back up.",
                    "THEN: Alex describes her own fears (dying, becoming a pity burden to Emilia) and the crew’s relentless prodding that forced her upright.",
                    "THEN: Nyati says she can’t yet see what will pull her up; Alex suggests starting by naming the weight keeping her down.",
                    "THEN: Nyati cites sleep debt, sheepishness, and hatred of having “lost control even for a few hours.”",
                    "THEN: Alex replies that one lapse doesn’t define a trait and that unknowns drive everyone crazy; sweeping up broken pottery together is the only fix—after Alina’s enforced shore leave in New Orleans.",
                    "THEN: Nyati agrees she can wallow a bit longer but asks Alex for a detailed account of the manic night.",
                    "THEN: Alex requests Nyati’s own version first; places a reassuring hand on Nyati’s under the blankets.",
                    "THEN: After a silent pause, Nyati recounts the eureka chain: 1) Emilia proves whole-mind transfer works, 2) Alina proves machine bodies are immune to Bridge pull, 3) therefore moving Alex’s mind to a synthetic substrate will sever the crossing, 4) Sam confirmed the logic.  “Move your mind, leave the body, and you’re free.”",
                    "THEN: Alex tears up, asks permission to hug.  Nyati nods one arm open.",
                    "THEN: Gentle hug; Alex gasps at sudden weightlessness, then breaks into uncontrollable, vertigo-induced giggling.",
                    "THEN: Nyati, bewildered, asks if this is what hope looks like.",
                    "THEN: Between laughs Alex calls Nyati a “motherducking genius,” notes nobody told her sooner, and recounts yesterday’s nude, morning-wood sprint that traumatized Pete, promising Nyati’s kiss will be forgotten.",
                    "THEN: Nyati deadpans that peer-review would require Pete to compare kisses; labels that a problem for “Future Us.”",
                    "THEN: Alex insists Nyati’s mad-scientist state was “performance-enhancing,” vows to retire her own “brat era.”",
                    "THEN: Nyati thanks Alex for distraction, says she might finally sleep, chooses to risk Alina’s 10-h floodlight alarm, and asks only to be warned “before the city invasion.”",
                    "THEN: Alex offers to be as annoying as necessary; Nyati mumbles “Thanks, Alex,” already drifting.",
                    "THEN: Alex exits quietly, door soft-clicking behind her.",
                    "THEN: In hallway she heads toward the bridge, glances inside: Alina at helm, Pete on monitors, no Emilia.",
                    "THEN: Without stopping she calls, “She’s fine. Leave her be,” and continues down the passageway looking for Emilia.  Episode ends."

A tense—but ultimately playful—rendezvous with Alina’s broker contact, Raven, nets two critical data sets: a leaked Echo-research fragment and a lead on a roaming Echo survivor.  Alex wins the negotiation by up-ending the contact’s leverage game, accepting payment in the form of a future, non-violent \"access\" favor, and christening herself and the team with impromptu Spice-Girl codenames.  The episode closes with intel in hand, a marker owed, and the promise of celebratory drinks under Emilia’s lead.",
