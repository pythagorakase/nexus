      "appearance": "Early-30s Creole woman, 5\u201910\u2019\u2019 and whip-lean\u2014every ounce of weight looks calculated for sprint or climb. Copper-brown skin freckled like oxidised copper rivets; the freckles darken after long console sessions thanks to trace-heat from her subdermal antennae (twin silver crescents hidden just behind each ear). Hair: close-cropped fade with a razor-straight centre part, sometimes dyed a matte midnight stripe that reads as \u2018raven wing\u2019 under UV. Eyes: fox-sharp, chicory-coffee brown, flicking constantly between three focal planes\u2014street, skyline, HUD read-outs on the inside of her contact lenses. Favours cracked black biker leathers over a charcoal linen duster whose cuff-linings unroll into palm-sized holo-slates. Underlayer: a static-net camisole that smells faintly of cedar oil and ozone, used to scatter most body-scan pulses. Keeps a thin silver stylus tucked behind her ear; doubles as lock-picking torque wrench. Walks with the efficient glide of a courier used to ankle-deep floodwater\u2014long stride, minimal splash.",
      "background": "Birth name Nadine Baptiste. Raised in the half-submerged Ninth Ward, scavenging hurricane-gutted datacentres with her older brother Luc. Learned to hot-patch servers using grocery-bag zip ties and car batteries before she was twelve. At nineteen, recruited by Dynacorp\u2019s Gulf Recovery Division as junior sys-forensic; believed she could make levees safer with cleaner intel. Four years in, uncovered falsified surge-barrier telemetry hiding corporate liability for 3,212 storm deaths. Refused hush money, leaked proof to a watchdog node\u2014and triggered her own black-flag dismissal plus 500 K-cred bounty. Luc disappeared that same week, presumed rendition. Nadine burned every traceable ID, re-christened herself \u2018Raven\u2019 after the Gulf fibre trunk courier handle she\u2019d used as a teen, and vanished upriver. In exile she built The Murmuration: a decentralised courier lattice where single data-packets are \u2018sharded\u2019 across dozens of street runners and reassembled only at destination, making snatch-and-grab extraction nearly impossible. Raven bankrolls the lattice through favour-banking and selective blackmail, but secretly funnels 30 % of profit into coastal mutual-aid pods trying to keep the next storm from swallowing another ward.",
      "personality": "Exterior: unflappable courtesy laced with sardonic humour; speaks in a low alto drawl that turns even threats into lullabies. Never wastes a word or gesture\u2014silence is part of the negotiation toolkit. Interior: compulsive pattern-spotter terrified of becoming a martyr; ethical backbone of rebar wrapped in self-preservation foam. Craves puzzles, fears helplessness, especially when storms roll in (hurricane sirens still trigger latent guilt). Mildly claustrophobic despite years in data-tunnels. Maintains a rulebook no one else sees: 1) No blood for bytes. 2) Debts are sacred. 3) Always leave enough evidence for history to condemn the powerful. Loves bad puns, secretly sketches tidal-barrier redesigns in her battered Moleskine margins.",
      "emotional_state": "Running on edge: Dynacorp\u2019s R-Search scraped a dead-drop; she suspects Luc is alive and forced to work for them. Equal parts exhilarated by Alex\u2019s disruptive style and terrified that caring will compromise operational discipline.",
      "current_activity": "Triangulating \u2018Lark\u2019, a rogue Echo shard Dynacorp is courting. Splicing NOAA buoy packet captures with the Echo leak she sold Alex; hash-collisions suggest Lark rides storm-monitor drones. Simultaneously orchestrating evacuation drills for three Murmuration courier nests should Infosec sweep the riverfront tonight. Pen-testing an old Jesuit bell-tower to turn into a secondary Nest if her current hide-out burns.",
      "current_location": "\u2018The Nest\u2019\u2014gutted bell-tower above St. Roch Market. Rooftop line-of-sight to Canal St fibre repeaters; interior strung with heat-sink chimes that mask jammer whine. Emergency egress: market service tunnels emptying into the Claiborne drainage culvert\u2014knee-deep but corp-scanner dark.",
