# Map Illustrator Implementation Progress

## Completed Features

1. **Base Script Structure**
   - Command-line argument parsing with `--fact` and `--creative` modes
   - Database connection and utility functions
   - Place and chunk retrieval logic

2. **Pydantic Models**
   - Created structured models for creative expansion
   - Implemented hierarchical structure for location details
   - Added ConfigDict with extra="forbid" to all models

3. **Place Reference Formatting**
   - Implemented per-chunk place reference formatting
   - Sorted references by zone with proper indentation
   - Added target place markers
   - Used box drawing characters as requested

4. **Fact Mode**
   - Successfully implemented fact mode extraction
   - Correctly formats prompts with place references per chunk
   - Tested and verified proper operation

## Remaining Issues

1. **Creative Mode Schema Issue**
   - OpenAI API returns error: "Invalid schema for response_format 'CreativeExpansion'"
   - Error indicates issue with required fields in nested schemas
   - We need to modify Pydantic model configuration to match OpenAI expectations
   - Most likely need to explicitly define required fields and handle nested models differently

2. **Potential Fixes to Try**:
   - Add `model_json_schema` method override to properly set required fields
   - Consider using different nesting approach for extra_data fields
   - Simplify the model structure if needed
   - Explore using `Field(required=True)` for explicitly required fields
   - Look at successful implementation in `creative_character_expansion.py` as a template

3. **Other Potential Enhancements**:
   - Add error handling for API response parsing
   - Improve test mode output to show more detailed schema information
   - Add debug mode with more verbose logging on API interactions

## Next Steps

1. Fix creative mode schema issues by comparing with working examples
2. Run comprehensive tests in fact and creative modes
3. Test with different place IDs to ensure proper handling of references
4. Verify database updates work correctly in non-debug mode
