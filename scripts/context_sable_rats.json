            "summary": "District 07 Shipping Yard is a decaying freight depot turned gang red-zone: a maze of rust-scarred container stacks encircling a lone warehouse whose humming server rack is the yard’s malignant heart. Once a linchpin of Night City’s shipping economy, it now functions as the Sable Rats’ contract hub and ambush ground, its corroded cranes and echoing corridors steeped in danger and secrecy.",

            ],
            "history": "Built in 2033 by Pacific Freight Line during Night City’s port boom, the yard once processed thousands of tons of cargo per week via rail and mag-hauler. Corporate divestment in the 2050s left District 07 to gang rule; automated cranes froze in place, and the workforce scattered. A decade ago the Sable Rats seized the fenced compound, welding gates shut and refitting the control warehouse as a covert data center. There they installed an air-gapped assassination-contract server, operating off scavenged generators and black-market quantum drives. Recent infiltration by the protagonist planted a stealth backdoor and sabotaged purge routines, and an EMP ambush of a corporate convoy has since left scorch marks and bullet scars across the container lanes.",
            "current_status": "The yard is active yet dilapidated: power flickers from patched generators, oily flood-lamps paint the stacks in sickly orange, and Sable Rat patrols prowl on cybernetic stilts and mono-wheeled drones. While outwardly abandoned, its server still pulses with illicit contracts, unaware that its logs are compromised. Tensions mount as rival gangs eye the site’s hardware windfall and the Rats tighten security after the recent convoy incident.",
            "secrets": "Beneath a welded floor grate lies a sealed utility tunnel leading to the city sewer—perfect for silent ingress or escape. The sabotaged server now mirrors its data to an unknown off-site node each midnight, evidence that someone other than the protagonist is tapping it. A refrigerated ‘cold-box’ container deep in the maze emits irregular bio-signs and draws unexplained power from the grid. Rumor among Rats says their unseen paymaster—code-named Blackjack—visits in person during acid-rain nights, escorted by unmarked AVs.",

What begins as a mission to understand the entity below becomes a confrontation with the boundaries of self, the dangers of digital immortality, and the trauma left in the wake of Project Echo. As Alex volunteers to be the first true test subject for the refined Nexus process, the team is forced to confront the reality of \"Echo Syndrome\"—the persistent, ineffable suffering experienced by digital survivors like Emilia. The season is marked by a shift in priorities: from racing to perfect Nexus as a technological solution, to centering the lived experience of its survivors and refusing to accept anything less than a process that preserves not just data, but identity and wholeness. Alongside this, the season explores the evolving relationship between Alex and Emilia, the ethical and technical challenges of digital mind transfer, and the search for other Echo survivors as both a scientific and moral imperative.

The season is defined by a series of “victory laps”—from the lighthearted (the adoption of Sullivan the cat, a legendary fine-dining experience, and a covert operation to launch Pete’s bisexual awakening) to the deeply vulnerable (Alex’s reckoning with her own mortality and future, and Nyati’s confrontation with the possibility of life beyond endless crisis management).\n\nThe narrative oscillates between comic relief and emotional depth: the crew’s infiltration of a cat café becomes a full-blown “crew expansion initiative”; a Michelin-starred dinner turns into a meditation on happiness and future-building; and a night out at a gay bar becomes both a successful mission for Pete and a catalyst for Alex and Nyati to confront their own hopes and fears.

                "OVERVIEW": "Episode 3 (“Illusions”) shifts from survival to counter-offensive.  Snake formalises an alliance with the digitised Alina Voss, ingests mescaline to hunt insight, and confirms a hidden second corporation—Halcyon Research Group—helped Dynacorp erase her.  A failed probe of Halcyon’s off-grid Aerodyne Facility escalates into full cyber-combat; Snake and Pete beat elite runner “Asmodeus” with a weaponised spam swarm and steal logs naming presumed-dead Dr. Adrian Lansky.  Snake frames Victor Sato for the intrusion, baits Lansky online via a fake “MindVault420” persona, and secures a clandestine Grid meeting.  Pete builds a locked digital safe-room while Alina designs a new wire-frame avatar and prepares to face another ghost in the machine.",
                "TIMELINE": [
                    "THEN: In Pete’s silo, Snake nods acceptance of Alina’s proposed alliance; Pete reacts with disbelief.",
                    "THEN: Trio agrees first objectives—gather intel on Project Blackout and fabricate Snake’s death; Snake suspects additional adversary beyond Dynacorp.",
                    "THEN: Plan set: review safehouse trap footage, scour dark-net chatter, gauge Sato’s pursuit status.",
                    "THEN: Snake self-doses mescaline; Pete joins as sitter; Alina observes.  Vision quest merges Snake’s perception with Alina’s code, revealing that a smaller firm partnered in her erasure.",
                    "THEN: Within the hallucination Snake confronts Alina’s spectral form; fragmented memory identifies “HALCYON RESEARCH GROUP”.",
                    "THEN: Post-trip, Snake briefs Pete; deep scans uncover Halcyon’s scrubbed corporate footprint and ongoing power draw at Aerodyne Research Facility.",
                    "THEN: Pete launches stealth probe; Halcyon relay detected but firewall triggers counter-trace by netrunner “ASMODEUS”.",
                    "THEN: Second incursion: Snake jacks in beside Pete; pair breach digital fortress; Asmodeus attacks with logic bombs; Snake releases bot swarm of pop-ups/crypto spam to choke bandwidth.",
                    "THEN: As Pete extracts Aerodyne security logs, Asmodeus vows retribution; team force-disconnects unseen.",
                    "THEN: Loot reveals quantum-processor shipments, active staffing, and repeated security clearance by \"DR. ADRIAN LANSKY\" (officially dead six years).",
                    "THEN: To redirect hostility, Snake forges intrusion logs with Sato’s keys and Dynacorp cryptography, planting them on a ghost server Halcyon monitors.",
                    "THEN: Investigating Lansky, Pete finds obituary, Dynacorp neural-imprint background, and AI-forum user “OMEGA//L”.",
                    "THEN: Snake and Pete scrape Omega//L post history; deleted thread hints Lansky is digitised and unstable.",
                    "THEN: Snake crafts trolling posts belittling digital minds as “Madlibs on a GPU”, creates burner persona “MindVault420”, and spams self-replies to provoke engagement.",
                    "THEN: Omega//L takes the bait, delivering long rebuttals; Snake pivots to earnest ignorance to keep him teaching.",
                    "THEN: Waiting for replies, Snake converses with Alina about her identity, emotions, and original work on Predictive Cognitive Mapping; learns Dynacorp uploaded her to marry intuition with controllable AI and to test post-mortem behavioural manipulation.",
                    "THEN: Snake presses Pete about his life; Pete reveals ex-corporate past, estranged family, and self-exile; Snake calls his bluff on not caring, strengthening their bond.",
                    "THEN: Overnight, Omega//L posts again, divulging that digitised minds evolve through incremental nudges and invites MindVault420 to “meet in the Grid.”",
                    "THEN: Alina analyses risks: potential Halcyon trap, need for controlled venue, she volunteers to enter first.",
                    "THEN: Option chosen—build proprietary secure host.  Pete assembles closed-loop relay with kill-switch and boardroom construct; decoy exit added.",
                    "THEN: Alina fashions neon wire-frame humanoid avatar—faceless, signalling partial disclosure.  Snake and Pete monitor ingress points for tails.",
                    "THEN: System ping reports incoming connection; episode ends as Lansky’s avatar prepares to enter controlled space."
