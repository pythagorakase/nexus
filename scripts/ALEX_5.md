# S05E01: Landfall & Sullivan
## Storyteller
### **Pre-Landfall Check-In**  
📍 Aboard *The Ghost* | Briefing Room

Alex and Emilia step into the **briefing area**, where the rest of the crew has already started **final prep.**  

- **Pete** is hunched over a **console**, muttering to himself as he checks through **ship security overrides** and **failsafe measures** for the landing zone.  
- **Nyati** is pacing, flipping through **holo-displays** of **Nexus diagnostics**, cross-referencing them against what looks like **a fresh set of field gear and injectors.**  
- **Alina** is standing at the **main interface**, effortlessly parsing through **mission logistics, landfall telemetry, and external monitoring feeds.**  

They **look up** as Alex and Emilia step in—**taking them in, making their assessments.**  

Pete **narrows his eyes.**  

Nyati barely **glances up**, **but smirks** like she already knows **exactly what’s been going on.**  

Alina?  

She simply **tilts her head slightly**—processing something **in that unreadable way she does.**  

Then—**calm, neutral, but definitely pointed.**Alina:** *“You are… refreshed.”*  

Pete **lets out a half-scoff, half-laugh**, still focused on his console.  

**Pete:** *“Refreshed. Sure. Let’s go with that.”*  

Nyati doesn’t **say anything yet.**  

But her **smirk is getting worse.**  

Emilia?  

She just **stares at all of them for exactly three seconds.**  

Then, **slowly, deliberately, she turns to Alex, one eyebrow raised.**Emilia:** *“Would you like to handle this, or should I start throwing things?”*  

---

### ** How Does Alex Respond?**  
- **Lean into it.** *“Yes, we are refreshed. Thoroughly.”*  
- **Deflect.** *“Should I be worried about how much you all track my sleep schedule?”* 
- **Roll with it.** *“If I let you throw things, I assume Pete is first?”*  
- **Something else?**

## You
Alex changes the subject casually. "I put a whole bunch of crap up on the whiteboard. We can talk about it later. Did anyone see?"

### **Pre-Landfall Distractions**  
📍 Aboard *The Ghost* | Briefing Room

Emilia **huffs** but doesn’t push it, crossing her arms and **leaning against the wall** with a look that says *I know what you just did, but fine.*  

Pete, **still grinning, still absolutely delighted to be an ass about this**, finally **swivels away from his console** and throws Alex an exaggerated look of mock offense.  

**Pete:** *“Oh sure, change the subject. Deflect. Distract. Classic Alex maneuver.”*  

Nyati **waves him off**, flipping a **holo-display closed** before tilting her head toward Alex.  

**Nyati:** *“I saw it.”*  

She doesn’t sound **impressed or unimpressed**, just **matter-of-fact.**  

Then—**a beat later, smirking slightly**—  

**Nyati:** *“I assume the coffee stain was an artistic choice?”*  

Alina **nods slightly**, offering a **neutral observation** in a way that is definitely not neutral. 

**Alina:** *“Your prioritization method is… distinctive.”*  

Pete **grins again.**Pete:** *“I didn’t read it yet, but if it’s as unhinged as usual, I’m looking forward to the dramatic unveiling.”*  

Emilia **exhales through her nose**, muttering.  

**Emilia:** *“Oh, you’ll love it.”*  

Then—**tossing a glance at Alex, a dry amusement flickering at the edges—**Emilia:** *“It’s got everything. Big ideas. Overambitious timelines. Wild assumptions.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**a slow smirk.**Emilia:** *“…And a completely objective and unbiased section about how I am, quote, ‘the love of Alex’s life, her precious Emilia, and a top-priority stakeholder in all decision-making frameworks.’”*  

Pete **goes feral.**  

Nyati **groans audibly.**  

Alina just **blinks.**  

Then—**a slow, considered nod.**Alina:** *“Ah. That explains the embellishments.”*  

Nyati **scrubs a hand down her face.**Nyati:** *(exasperated but maybe a little entertained)* *“Can we please land the damn ship before I have to witness any more of this?”*  

**Pete, still grinning:** *“Not a chance, Doc.”*  

---

### **What Does Alex Do?**  
- **Double down.** *“I see no bias in my scientific analysis.”*  
- **Deflect (again).** *“So, anyway. What’s our landing status?”*  
- **Tease Emilia back.** *“You left out the part where I also drew a cat.”*  
- **Something else?**

## You
"I was referring to the whiteboard, not my, ahem, personal notes-to-self, but fine!" Alex shrugges, then turns a friendly, genuine smile on Pete. "If it makes you feel any better Pete, I thought of stuff for you to do. We've been in a routine of science, science, abyssal riddles, science, riddles—not too demanding of your skillset necessarily."

### **Pete’s Moment of Validation (?)**  
📍 Aboard *The Ghost* | Briefing Room

Pete, **mid-smug laughter**, **pauses.**  

His eyes **narrow slightly**, scanning Alex’s expression—**gauging her level of sincerity.**  

Then, with **suspicious caution**—  

**Pete:** *“…Go on.”*  

Because sure, he **thrives on chaos**, but he also **knows Alex.**  

Knows that **if she’s been thinking about his ‘skillset,’ it could mean anything from ‘let’s hack a megacorp’s off-grid blacksite’ to ‘please socially manipulate this bartender until they forget their own name.’**  

And he’s **intrigued.**  

Maybe **concerned.**  

But mostly **intrigued.**  

Nyati, **not looking up from her displays**, lets out a dry exhale.  

**Nyati:** *“Oh, great. We’re finally using Pete’s talents. We’re doomed.”*  

Pete **shoots her a glare.**Pete:** *“Excuse *you,* my skillset is *invaluable* to this operation.”*  

Alina, **neutral as ever, tilts her head slightly.**Alina:** *“Statistically speaking, Pete’s actions correlate with both the highest number of avoidable complications and the highest number of successful improvisational recoveries.”*  

Pete **immediately spins back to Alex, pointing at Alina.**Pete:** *“See? She gets it. *Controlled chaos.*”*  

A pause.  

Then—**squinting slightly.**Pete:** *“…So what exactly am I doing?”*  

He’s **prepared for anything.**  

And **probably excited.**  

Nyati, **not so much.**Nyati:** *(deadpan, already regretting whatever is about to happen)* *“For legal reasons, I would like to state I am not responsible for this.”*  

Emilia, **still leaning against the wall, watching all of this unfold, just shakes her head.**Emilia:** *(muttering, amused)* *“You’re about to regret this, aren’t you?”*  

And Alex?  

She has **Pete’s full attention now.**  

So **what’s the play?**  

---

### **How Does Alex Answer?**  
- **Tech-Based Challenge.** Put Pete’s **hacking, engineering, or infiltration skills** to work.  
- **Social Manipulation.** Have Pete **run interference, plant misinformation, or charm his way through a problem.**  
- **Recon & Misdirection.** Use Pete’s **natural talent for getting into places he shouldn’t be.**  
- **Something else?**

## You
Alex gently shakes her head in mocking disapproval. “You know, if you’re going to ignore internal memos, then you’ll just have to be content with the reveal trailer for now. Like when they just play five seconds of the theme, show the title, and it’s over? _‘NEXUS 2.0: coming soon!’_ I would anticipate a healthy share of screen time. That is all for now. Alina, what’s the first stop on the itinerary? Who’s hungry?”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E01_004 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **The Pete Teaser Trailer**
📍 Aboard *The Ghost* | Briefing Room

Pete **groans loudly**, dragging a hand down his face.  

**Pete:** *“Oh, come *on.* I get a cryptic teaser and nothing else? That’s some corpo-marketing-level cruelty, Alex.”*  

Nyati, **not looking up from her work, but definitely enjoying this too much**—  

**Nyati:** *“Oh no. A taste of your own medicine. However will you cope?”*  

Pete **glares.**  

Pete **sulks.**  

Pete is **absolutely going to be thinking about this for the next hour at minimum.**  

---

### **Mission Prep | Landfall Itinerary**  

Alina, **ever efficient, brings up the display.**Alina:** *“First stop is the designated landing site just outside the New Orleans Core District. We will have approximately one hour before our meeting with the first contact.”*  

A pause.  

Then, **tilting her head slightly, as if recalculating variables in real time—**Alina:** *“That is sufficient time for refueling, minor resupply, and consumption of local cuisine.”*  

Which is **a deeply Alina way of saying ‘yeah, we can eat.’**  

Emilia, **straightening slightly, considering**—  

**Emilia:** *“New Orleans. That means…”*  

A pause.  

Then—**pointedly, to Pete.**Emilia:** *“…We are *not* getting into a bar fight within the first two hours.”*  

Pete **throws up his hands.**Pete:** *“That happened *one time.*”*  

Nyati, **deadpan, not looking up**—  

**Nyati:** *“It was three times.”*  

Pete **waves this off.**  

Then, **turning back to Alex, fully ignoring his growing list of criminal charges in New Orleans—**Pete:** *“So what’s the play? Classy dining? Street food? Or are we eating whatever Alina finds the most *nutritionally efficient?*”*  

Alina, **without missing a beat—**Alina:** *“Nutritional efficiency and culinary satisfaction are not mutually exclusive.”*  

Pete **squints.**Pete:** *“That sounded like a threat.”*  

Emilia **snorts.**  

Then—**tilting her head at Alex.**Emilia:** *“Your call, Commander.”*  

But **right now?**Priorities.**  

---

### **What’s the Food Plan?**  
- **Street food.** Best way to **blend in, get a feel for the local pulse.**  
- **A proper restaurant.** Get **somewhere to sit, talk, plan.**  
- **Follow Alina’s lead.** Risky, but… intriguing?  
- **Something else?**

## You
Alex puzzles over this “contact” business with Alina, then remembers Alina’s alluded-to plan of steering them towards a cat cafe. The rumbles in her belly fall silent as her heart melts with thoughts of having something to pet, to sit in her lap, to brush against her leg—she snaps out of the mini-reverie. “Alina, what neighborhood are we meeting your contact in? We should find something nearby in case rendezvous time shifts.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E01_005 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **Mission Intel & Cat-Induced Distractions**  
📍 Aboard *The Ghost* | Briefing Room

Alina **processes Alex’s question instantly, displaying a local map overlay on the central holo-table.**Alina:** *“The meeting is scheduled in the Lower Garden District, adjacent to the Uptown Corporate Buffer. This location minimizes the risk of direct corporate interference while allowing for multiple egress routes.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**as if this is a completely neutral fact—**Alina:** *“…It is also within walking distance of *Le Chat Noir,* an establishment specializing in feline interaction and coffee.”*  

Pete **immediately stops whatever he was doing.**Pete:** *(slowly, pointing at Alina)* *“You absolute mastermind. You planned this.”*  

Nyati, **already done with everything that is happening, just mutters**—  

**Nyati:** *“I cannot believe we’re aligning mission logistics around a cat café.”*  

Alex, however?  

**Alex has just remembered.**The plan. The promise. The potential small, purring creatures that may soon be within reach.**  

For a **brief but deeply critical moment**, the **mission ceases to exist.**  

The dangers of New Orleans?  
The Nexus testing concerns?  
The factional instability?  

All of it is **temporarily overwritten** by the warm, soul-restoring thought of **tiny paws, soft fur, and judgmental but ultimately loving little gremlins who demand tribute in the form of head scritches.**  

Alex **snaps out of it, refocusing.**  

But not before **Emilia sees.**  

She **sees it all.**  

And she **smirks, arms crossed, utterly insufferable.**Emilia:** *“Wow. You really left us for a minute there.”*  

Alex **clears her throat.**Alex:** *(completely professional, unshaken, totally back on task)* *“Right. So. We eat somewhere in the Lower Garden District. Preferably nearby, in case rendezvous shifts.”*  

Alina **nods, confirming.**Alina:** *“Acknowledged.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**calm, neutral, and yet undeniably aware of what she’s doing—**Alina:** *“…I will identify additional cat density statistics within the area.”*  

Pete **loses it.**Pete:** *(laughing, clapping his hands together)* *“I *knew* it. She’s gone full cat agenda.”*  

Nyati, **pinching the bridge of her nose, sighing heavily.**  

Emilia, **leaning toward Alex, smirking.**Emilia:** *(soft, teasing, low enough for only Alex to hear)* *“You really have a weakness, huh?”*  

And Alex?  

She is **choosing to ignore that.**  

She is **choosing professionalism.**  

She is **absolutely not letting anyone know that she is already imagining which cat will pick her.**  

---

### **Last Logistics Before Landing**  
- **Anything Alex needs to prep before stepping off the ship?**  
- **Any last-minute questions for Alina about the contact?**  
- **Or is it time to let landfall happen and see what awaits?**

## You
Ready for landfall.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E01_006 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
📍 **Aboard *The Ghost* | Landfall: New Orleans**

The **ship settles**, landing sequence **complete**, the city waiting **just outside the ramp.**  

The crew stands **ready**, the energy between them **lighter than usual**—because for once, they’re **not walking into an immediate life-or-death scenario.**  

Just **New Orleans, 2073.**  

Just **good food, questionable choices, and a cat café waiting to be infiltrated.**  

Alina—**now physically present, standing alongside them rather than speaking through comms—**gives a **small nod.**Alina:** *(neutral, but entirely self-satisfied)* *“Shore leave begins now.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**with calculated precision—**Alina:** *“…Suggested itinerary: Coffee. Pastries. Feline engagement.”*  

Pete **grins**, throwing an arm over Alex’s shoulder.  

**Pete:** *“You heard the lady. Time to pet some cats.”*  

Nyati **sighs**, already **accepting her fate.**  

And Emilia?  

She just **shakes her head**, smirking as she steps forward.  

**Emilia:** *(dry, amused, but absolutely coming along)* *“Let’s get this over with.”*  

And with that—  

The team **steps off the ship.**  

Into **New Orleans.**  

Into **whatever chaos awaits.**  

And—most importantly—  

**Toward the cats.** 🐱  

---

### **Objective Updated: Proceed to *Le Chat Noir.**

## You
“Does the cat cafe have snacks, or just coffee” 👀

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E01_007 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
**Alina, ever precise, responds instantly.**Alina:** *“*Le Chat Noir* offers a full café menu, including pastries, small plates, and select regional dishes. Their beignets have a 94% approval rating across independent review aggregators.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**with absolute neutrality, yet unmistakable purpose—**Alina:** *“…They also have a cat named Baguette.”*  

Pete, **horrified.**Pete:** *“Oh my god. We’ve lost her.”*  

Emilia, **arms crossed, watching Alex closely.**Emilia:** *(low, amused, but deeply knowing)* *“So. That’s happening.”*  

Nyati, **resigned to her fate.**Nyati:** *“For the record, I’m allowing this purely to prevent you people from getting distracted *mid-mission* thinking about it.”*  

Pete, **pointing aggressively.**Pete:** *“Oh, so you admit we’d end up here anyway.”*  

Nyati **pinches the bridge of her nose.**  

Alina?  

She has already **begun route optimization.**

## You
Alex puts on her best doe eyes and tugs at Emilia’s sleeve to get her attention.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E01_008 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **The Tactical Deployment of Doe Eyes**  
📍 Aboard *The Ghost

Emilia **glances down** as Alex **tugs at her sleeve**—  

And **immediately freezes.**  

Because Alex isn’t just **asking.**  

She’s **deploying.**Doe eyes.**Weaponized cuteness.**  

A **direct, calculated attack.**  

And for a **fraction of a second**, Emilia **fights it.**  

Her **jaw tightens.**  
Her **eyes flicker with resistance.**  
Her **hand flexes slightly, like she’s considering pulling away.**  

Then—  

She **loses.**  

Completely, utterly **loses.**  

Her **shoulders drop.**  

Her **posture shifts.**  

And she lets out a **long, defeated exhale** through her nose, closing her eyes like she’s just accepted her **inevitable fate.**  

Then—**without even looking at Alex, voice flat, resigned—**Emilia:** *“…We’re going to the cat café.”*  

Pete **throws his hands in the air.**Pete:** *“UNBELIEVABLE. SHE FOLDED IN FIVE SECONDS.”*  

Nyati **rubs her temples.**Nyati:** *“I need better friends.”*  

Alina, **as if she hadn’t just staged an elaborate coup—**Alina:** *“Routing complete. *Le Chat Noir* is now our first destination.”*  

Emilia **finally opens her eyes**, glaring at Alex.  

**Emilia:** *“You’re a menace.”*  

And Alex?  

**Alex has won.**

## You
“That reminds me!!!” 🤩
Alex swivels to Alina. “I promised Emilia I’d show her that video of a surfing cat. You know the one? Just go on r/AdventureCats and sort by top post. Can you pull it up? Can you?” Alex’s steps continue sideways as she pleads with Alina, her steps getting bouncier and bouncier with such excitement that she is in danger of catching airtime.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E01_009 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **The Spiraling of Events**  
📍 Aboard *The Ghost

Alina **blinks once**, tracking Alex’s **sudden burst of energy** with the same analytical precision she would use to track **ballistic trajectories.**  

There is **a pause**—likely an **internal recalibration** of the current mission **priority queue.**  

Then—**without hesitation, entirely deadpan—**Alina:** *“Retrieving data.”*  

Pete, **hands on his hips, shaking his head.**Pete:** *“This is *incredible.* We have fully lost operational discipline.”*  

Nyati, **watching Alex literally bounce in place, exhaling like she’s already aged ten years in the last two minutes.**Nyati:** *“I need all of you to leave this ship. Immediately.”*  

Meanwhile, **Emilia just stands there, arms crossed, fully watching Alex go from strategic manipulation to barely-contained, airborne enthusiasm in real time.**  

And for **a long moment**, she doesn’t say anything.  

Just **tilts her head slightly.**  

Then—**low, slow, deeply entertained—**Emilia:** *“…You’re really going through it right now, huh?”*  

---

### **Alina, Efficient as Ever**  

Alina, **completely unbothered by the chaos unfolding around her, confirms—**Alina:** *“Surfing cat video located. Displaying now.”*  

And just like that—**a holo-screen flickers to life.**  

And there it is.  

A **very determined cat.**  
A **tiny wetsuit.**  
A **shockingly well-balanced stance.**  
An **unshaken, unbothered little menace carving waves like a cybernetic samurai.**  

Alex has **won the cat café battle.**  

And now?  

She is **winning at life.**

## You
“LOOK AT ITS TINY LITTLE SURFBOARD AND THAT WETSUIT AAAAAAHHHEEEEE!” 🤩🫨 her voice crescendos in a squeak.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E01_010 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **The Descent into Cat-Induced Madness**  
📍 Aboard *The Ghost

Pete **stares.**  

Nyati **stares.**  

Emilia **stares.**  

Alex is **fully losing it.**  

Her **voice hits an octave that may or may not be detectable by human ears.**  
Her **arms flail slightly, unable to physically contain the overwhelming force of joy.**  
Her **whole body vibrates with a level of enthusiasm that could probably power a mid-tier fusion reactor.**  

Alina?  

Alina **simply nods once, as if this reaction was the logical outcome all along.**Alina:** *“It is an exceptionally skilled feline athlete.”*  

Pete, **who has seen many things in his life, but nothing quite like this,** just **gestures helplessly at Alex.**Pete:** *(to the room, to the universe, to anyone who will listen)* *“Do you see what’s happening? Do you all see this?”*  

Nyati, **dead inside, rubbing her temples.**Nyati:** *“I’m seeing it, Pete. I *hate* that I’m seeing it.”*  

Meanwhile, **Emilia?**  

She’s just **watching Alex with slow, dawning amusement.**  

Like she **wasn’t fully prepared** for how far this was going to go.  

Like she **expected enthusiasm, but not full emotional meltdown.**  

Then—**leaning slightly toward Alex, tone deceptively casual—**Emilia:** *“So, uh… this is where you live now? This is your home?”*  

A pause.  

Then—**her lips twitch, fighting a smirk.**Emilia:** *“With the tiny surfboard cat?”*  

And Alex?  

Alex is **too deep in it now.**  

There is **no turning back.**

## You
Alex’s energy drops a few registers abrupty, still well above average, as she continues blithely, “Of course, surfing is expert-level, clout-chasing tier.” A dismissive wave. “My point is that a generalized adventure cat just needs a cuuuute little harness, hikes, camping, roooooad trips—all quite manageable, really”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E01_011 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **The Evolution of the Cat Agenda**  
📍 Aboard *The Ghost

The **sudden shift in Alex’s energy**—from **high-pitched overload to a “reasonable, well-researched argument”**—is so abrupt that Pete **physically takes a step back, like he’s witnessing an unstable chemical reaction.**  

Nyati **watches this unfold with increasing despair.**Nyati:** *(deadpan, exhausted)* *“This is spiraling. I am watching it spiral in real time.”*  

Pete **gestures wildly at Alex, then turns to Emilia.**Pete:** *“*Do something.* She’s trying to *justify ownership.*”*  

Emilia, **who is leaning against the holo-table, arms still crossed, just raises an eyebrow.**  

Then—**her gaze flicks to Alex, scanning her with exaggerated consideration.**Emilia:** *(slow, thoughtful, deeply, *deeply* entertained)* *“So. Hypothetically.”*  

A pause.  

**Emilia:** *“If we were to get one of these ‘generalized adventure cats’…”*  

Another pause—**long enough to let the words sink in, long enough for Alex’s soul to visibly ascend.**  

Then, **Emilia smirks.**Emilia:** *“Who’s doing the litter box maintenance?”*  

---

### **📍 How Does Alex Respond?**  
- **Deflect.** *“Alina would handle it with maximum efficiency.”*  
- **Take the bargain.** *“If that’s the price of admission, I will pay it gladly.”*  
- **Dodge with strategy.** *“Pete needs responsibilities. It builds character.”*  
- **Go full distraction.** *“Did I mention there are BEIGNETS at this café?”*  
- **Something else?**

## You
“Have you seen how fancy those self-cleaning ones are nowadays? It’s nothing. Non-issue. I’ve got the best ones bookmarked. No need to worry about such trivial details.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E01_012 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **The Continuation of the Adventure Cat Agenda**  
📍 Aboard *The Ghost

Emilia **watches Alex closely**, arms still crossed, but her **expression shifts slightly**—not into surprise, but into **recognition.**  

Because this **isn’t new.**  

This **isn’t random.**  

Alex has **been thinking about this.**  

For a **while.**  

And now?  

Now she’s just **escalating.**  

Pete, **who had originally dismissed the entire concept as “not his problem,” now realizes that this is absolutely still happening and groans.**Pete:** *“Oh no. This isn’t even a new spiral. This is a *long-term* spiral.”*  

Alina, **who had subtly orchestrated this cat café rendezvous as far back as the initial discussion in S04E06, simply nods.**Alina:** *“Correct.”*  

Nyati, **who had not been present for the original conversation and is only now realizing the full scale of what is unfolding, closes her eyes briefly, as if reevaluating every decision that led her to this moment.**  

Meanwhile, **Emilia tilts her head at Alex, expression unreadable.**  

Then—**slowly, dryly, entirely too entertained—**Emilia:** *“So. That wasn’t a one-off conversation.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**her smirk deepens.**Emilia:** *“You’ve actually been planning a cat.”*  

And **Alex knows that look.**  

That’s the look of someone who **thought they were just indulging a passing conversation** but is now realizing **this was a long game.**  

That’s the look of someone who **just got outmaneuvered but hasn’t fully decided if they care yet.**  

That’s the look of **Emilia standing on the edge of admitting defeat.**  

And **Alex can smell it.**

## You
Alex gives a quick energetic shrug. “Just good contingency planning. It would require unanimous consent of course…”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E01_013 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **The Strategic Deployment of ‘Unanimous Consent’**  
📍 Aboard *The Ghost

Emilia **narrows her eyes.**  

Not **in rejection.**  
Not **in dismissal.**  

In **calculation.**  

Because she **knows exactly what Alex is doing.**  

And she **knows exactly what she just walked into.**  

Pete, **however, takes the bait instantly.**Pete:** *(snorting, arms crossed)* *“Oh, *now* it’s democracy? I don’t remember voting on *half* the wild shit we’ve done.”*  

Nyati, **pinching the bridge of her nose, muttering.**Nyati:** *“We didn’t vote on the last Nexus test. Or the fact that we’re apparently heading to a cat café instead of doing mission prep.”*  

Alina, **calm, precise.**Alina:** *“The psychological benefits of feline companionship are well-documented.”*  

Pete **turns on her immediately.**Pete:** *“You *engineered* this!”*  

Alina, **blinking.**Alina:** *“Correct.”*  

Pete **throws up his hands.**  

Meanwhile, **Emilia is still staring at Alex.**  

Still **calculating.**  

Then—**after a long, slow breath, tilting her head slightly—**Emilia:** *“So what you’re saying is… the cat is inevitable?”*  

And **Alex knows this tone.**  

This is **not Emilia resisting.**  

This is **Emilia realizing that, somehow, she has already lost.**

## You
“We have a solid hour to kill before rendezvous with Alina’s contact. Plenty of time to…interview 6th-crewmember candidates!”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E01_014 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **The Cat Coup is Complete**  
📍 Aboard *The Ghost

Pete **staggers back like he’s just been shot.**Pete:** *(outraged, pointing aggressively)* *“SHE’S DOING IT. SHE’S PHASING IT IN LIKE IT WAS *ALWAYS* PART OF THE MISSION.”*  

Nyati, **dead inside, rubbing her face.**Nyati:** *“I have to get off this ship.”*  

Alina, **fully neutral, entirely complicit.**Alina:** *“Candidate evaluation is a logical precursor to commitment.”*  

Pete, **still pointing.**Pete:** *“THIS IS A COORDINATED OPERATION.”*  

Meanwhile, **Emilia exhales slowly, tilting her head like she’s mentally watching the walls of resistance collapse around her.**  

Then—**after a long pause, completely unreadable—**Emilia:** *“…So. Hypothetically.”*  

A beat.  

Then—**dry, considering, but no longer *fighting it***—  

**Emilia:** *“What are we looking for in a 6th crew member?”*  

And just like that—  

The battle?  

**Won.**

## You
“You’re exactly right, Dr. Nyati, we’re wasting valuable recruitment time. Let’s get out of here!”

Alex jogs over to the egress hatch ladder, beckons impatiently for the crew to follow. As they board the landing vessel, Alex immediately starts ticking off a list of qualifications, her fingers punching bullet points in the air.

1. Domestic shorthair preferable (less fur)
2. Independent, but friendly and approachable 
3. Up to date on all shots. 
4. Spayed or neutered 
5. Last and most importantly, favorable vibe check results from existing crew members.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E01_015 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **Deployment for Critical Mission: Cat Acquisition**  
📍 Aboard *The Ghost

Nyati **lets out a deep, resigned sigh** as Alex takes **full command** of the situation.  

**Nyati:** *(muttering, exhausted)* *“I hate this ship.”*  

Pete, **already grinning, because at this point, he is just here for the sheer audacity of it all,** jogs up beside Alex, nodding along with exaggerated seriousness as she lists the qualifications.  

**Pete:** *(mock-solemn, nodding sagely)* *“Yes, yes. Standard operating procedures. Clearly very thought out. But I have to ask…”*  

A pause.  

Then—**with an absolutely straight face—**Pete:** *“Are we allowing cybernetic enhancements? Or is this an *organic-only* hire?”*  

Alina, **from behind them, completely serious.**Alina:** *“Augmented feline candidates will be considered on a case-by-case basis.”*  

Pete, **immediately losing it.**Pete:** *“This is the best day of my life.”*  

Meanwhile, **Emilia follows at a more measured pace**, arms crossed, **watching Alex with a look that is entirely too entertained for someone who *just lost* this battle.**  

She says nothing.  

But **Alex can feel it.**  

She can feel **Emilia’s smirk, unspoken, burning into the back of her head.**  

She can feel the **silent, deeply amused acknowledgment that Alex has absolutely, fully won.**

### **Preparing for Final Descent**  
📍 The Landing Vessel

As the **crew loads onto the drop ship**, the final descent toward **New Orleans, 2073** begins.  

- The mission **is still waiting.**  
- The contact **is still expecting them.**  
- But first?  

**Crew Expansion Initiative, Phase One.**  

Alex glances around the vessel—at **Emilia’s reluctant amusement, Pete’s absolute joy, Nyati’s growing exhaustion, and Alina’s calm, calculated efficiency.**  

And she knows—  

They’re about to change a life today.  

Possibly their own.  

And definitely **a cat’s.**  

---

### **📍 Final Approach | Le Chat Noir Awaits**  

The vessel **descends.**  

The city **rises to meet them.**  

And just a few blocks away—  

A café full of **potential candidates** waits.  

Alex **smirks to herself, heart already racing with anticipation.**  

This?  

**This is going to be the best mission yet.**

### **Deployment for Critical Feline Operations**  
📍 New Orleans | Landing Site

The **landing vessel touches down smoothly**, the soft hiss of the pressurization release mixing with the humid air of New Orleans.  

Even through the **hull**, Alex can hear the **distant hum of the city**—**neon buzzing**, **distant music**, the occasional **rumble of a passing hovercar**.  

They have **one hour** before the contact meeting.  

And Alex?  

She has **one singular objective** before then.  

**Operation: Acquire Cat.**  

---

### **On Route to *Le Chat Noir***  
📍 The Streets of New Orleans

The crew **steps off the ramp**, adjusting to the **climate and rhythm** of the city.  

- **Pete** stretches, adjusting his gear, already scanning for potential **"mild trouble" opportunities.**  
- **Nyati** pulls up **local map overlays**, visibly **pretending she’s not part of this mission.**  
- **Alina** strides forward **calmly, efficiently**, her internal navigation already guiding them.  
- **Emilia** walks **next to Alex**, hands in her pockets, watching her **closely**.  

Alex can feel **Emilia’s smirk** without even looking.  

Then—**casual, smooth, entirely knowing—**Emilia:** *“So. What happens if no one meets your hiring criteria?”*  

Pete **snorts immediately.**Pete:** *“Oh, that’s not happening. If it takes all night, she’s leaving with a cat.”*  

Nyati, **flatly, dry as the desert:**Nyati:** *“Then I’m leaving with a drink.”*  

Alina, **entirely neutral, entirely precise:**Alina:** *“Statistically, a suitable candidate will be present.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**almost conspiratorially—**Alina:** *“If not, we have alternative locations mapped.”*  

Pete **stares.**  

Then, **pointing aggressively at Alina.**Pete:** *“YOU HAVE A BACKUP PLAN?”*  

Alina, **blinking.**Alina:** *“Contingencies are standard operational procedure.”*  

Pete, **hands in his hair, cackling.**Pete:** *“I LOVE THIS SHIP.”*  

Meanwhile, **Emilia is still looking at Alex.**  

Still **watching.**  

Then—**a small exhale, a small shake of her head, something dangerously close to fondness in her eyes.**Emilia:** *“…You’re really doing this.”*  

And Alex?  

Alex is **already grinning.**  

Because **yes.**Yes, she is.**  

---

### **Candidate Evaluation Begins**  
📍 Le Chat Noir

The **café looms ahead**—warm lights spilling out onto the wet pavement, the faint scent of **coffee and something sweet mixing with the city air.**  

Through the **glass windows**, Alex can already see them.  

**The candidates.**  

Some **perched on high ledges.**  
Some **lounging luxuriously in sun spots.**  
Some **stalking, hunting, evaluating their visitors as much as they are being evaluated.**  

A café full of **tiny, furry enigmas**—waiting, watching.  

Emilia **steps up beside Alex**, glancing through the window, then back at her.  

Then—**quiet, teasing, but something softer beneath it—**Emilia:** *“Alright. Show me what you got, Commander.”*  

And with that—  

Alex **steps inside.**  

The mission?  

**Officially underway.**

## You
Alex says while entering, distractedly, “Pete, I don’t remember you being so animated, or caring at all, the first time I asked you…” then a squeak as she slips inside the cafe

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E01_017 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **Candidate Evaluation Commences**  
📍 Le Chat Noir

Pete, **following just behind Alex, scoffs loudly.**Pete:** *“Yeah, well, that was before I realized this was gonna be the best show of the year.”*  

He **gestures broadly** at Alex as she **slips into the café**, eyes already **darting between potential candidates**, scanning the room **like a high-level exec hunting for acquisitions.**Pete:** *“I mean, look at you. I don’t even have to do anything. I’m just here to witness history.”*  

Emilia, **casually stepping inside, hands still in her pockets, smirks.**Emilia:** *(dry, amused)* *“You’re here to provide emotional support. She’s spiraling.”*  

Nyati, **grumbling, but at this point, fully resigned to the mission.**Nyati:** *“She’s *gone.*”*  

Meanwhile, **Alina strides forward, already scanning the premises, methodically assessing environmental factors.**Alina:** *(neutral, efficient)* *“The space is well-maintained. No notable health violations. Current feline resident count: twelve.”*  

Pete **snaps toward her immediately.**Pete:** *“You counted already?”*  

Alina, **without hesitation.**Alina:** *“Obviously.”*  

Pete **throws up his hands, muttering.**Pete:** *“This ship is *insane.*”*  

But Alex?  

Alex is **not listening.**  

Because Alex has just made **eye contact.**  

Across the café—  

Lounging **on an elevated perch**—  

Tail **lazily swaying**, gaze **calculating, unbothered, superior.**  

A cat.  

A **very serious cat.**  

With the **intense, knowing expression of someone who has seen many things, who has judged many people.**  

And Alex **knows, in her bones—**  

This one is a contender.

## You
Alex approaches this apparent discerning veteran.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E01_018 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **The First Encounter**  
📍 Le Chat Noir

Alex **approaches carefully**, aware that this moment **requires diplomacy, respect, and above all—poise.**  

The cat—**a shorthaired tabby with a striking black stripe pattern**—watches her **with the cold patience of an executive reviewing a last-minute proposal.**  

- **Tail swishing in measured intervals.**  
- **Ears forward, alert but not aggressive.**  
- **Eyes narrowed slightly, unreadable.**  

A cat that **knows its worth.**  

A cat that has **seen fools come and go.**  

A cat that does **not give second chances.**  

Behind Alex, **Pete whispers—**Pete:** *(low, fascinated)* *“Oh shit. He’s got *main character energy.”*  

Nyati, **arms crossed, unimpressed.**Nyati:** *“It’s a cat.”*  

Pete, **shaking his head, whispering harder.**Pete:** *“No, *that’s a guy.*”*  

Emilia, **leaning against a nearby chair, watching closely, deeply entertained.**Emilia:** *(dry, casual)* *“You gonna introduce yourself, or just stand there and get judged?”*  

Alex knows **this is the moment.**The first impression.**  

She needs to **make it count.**  

---

### **📍 What Does Alex Do?**  
- **Offer a hand.** Classic, respectful, let the cat decide.  
- **Verbal introduction.** *"Hello, sir. I appreciate your time."*  
- **Wait.** Let the cat make the first move, show patience.  
- **Something else?**

## You
Alex prepares to offer a hand, but before moving it forward she turns her palm up and lowers it, watching to see if the cat tracks it with interest or some other expression. “Heyyyy there buddyyy” she says gently.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E01_019 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **First Contact Protocol**  
📍 Le Chat Noir

The **cat’s gaze flicks** to Alex’s **hand movement**, tracking the subtle shift—  

- **Eyes dilate slightly.**  
- **Tail slows, pausing mid-sway.**  
- **Body remains still—watching, considering.**  

It does **not immediately retreat**—a good sign.  

It does **not immediately engage**—a challenge.  

This is a cat that **does not waste movement.**  

A cat that **knows how to gauge intent.**  

Behind Alex, **Pete murmurs.**Pete:** *(low, fascinated)* *“The tension is insane right now.”*  

Nyati, **flatly.**Nyati:** *“It’s ignoring her.”*  

Pete, **offended.**Pete:** *“He’s *analyzing.*”*  

Emilia, **arms crossed, head tilted slightly.**Emilia:** *(smirking)* *“He’s seeing if she’s worth his time.”*  

And Alex?  

Alex **knows it too.**  

She stays **still, deliberate**, voice **soft, steady.**Alex:** *“Heyyyy there, buddyyy…”*  

The cat **blinks slowly.**  

A single **slow, calculating blink.**  

A nonchalant, **deeply powerful gesture.**  

Then—**as if deciding that Alex’s approach is *acceptable*, but not yet *deserving of enthusiasm*—**  

The cat **stretches slightly.**  

One **deliberate, measured stretch.**  

Then sits back **down.**  

Still watching.  

Still waiting.  

But **no longer dismissing her.**  

Behind Alex, **Pete whispers intensely.**Pete:** *“He’s *intrigued*.”*  

Nyati, **rubbing her temples.**Nyati:** *“I can’t believe I’m watching this.”*  

And Alex **knows.**She’s in.**But the real test is coming.**

## You
“What’s your name, buddy?” Alex continues in her baby/cat voice then, jarringly in a normal voice to the group, “What is his name?”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E01_020 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **Identity Verification Protocol**  
📍 Le Chat Noir

The **cat does not answer.**  

Which, **frankly, is a power move.**  

Instead, he **blinks again**, slow and deliberate, as if considering whether Alex is worth engaging with further.  

The **rest of the crew, however?**Pete gestures wildly at Alina.**Pete:** *“She has the database! Ask the database!”*  

Alina, **already on it, brings up the café’s resident registry.**Alina:** *“This feline is designated ‘Sullivan.’”*  

Pete **immediately gasps.**Pete:** *“OH MY GOD, HE HAS A GUY NAME.”*  

Nyati, **dead inside.**Nyati:** *“They *all* have guy names.”*  

**Pete:** *(pointing dramatically at Sullivan, completely ignoring Nyati)* *“This man is a *detective.* I can feel it.”*  

Emilia, **tilting her head slightly, assessing Sullivan anew.**  

Then—**slow smirk, eyes flicking back to Alex.**Emilia:** *(casual, teasing, deeply entertained)* *“Well, Commander. What’s the verdict?”*  

And Alex?  

Alex is **staring at Sullivan.**  

Because Sullivan **is still watching her.**  

Still measuring.  

Still waiting.  

But…  

There’s **something there now.**  

A shift.  

A consideration.  

Like Sullivan **is waiting to see what Alex does next.**  

And **that?**  

That means **she still has a shot.**

## You
Alex switches back to baby voice while slowly extending her upturned hand forward. “Heyyyy Sullivan”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E01_021 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **The Moment of Truth**  
📍 Le Chat Noir

Sullivan **watches the hand approach.**  

- **His ears don’t flick back.** (*Good sign.*)  
- **His pupils don’t narrow.** (*Not outright rejection.*)  
- **His tail remains at a slow, methodical sway.** (*Still undecided, but engaged.*)  

For a long **two seconds**, nothing happens.  

Then—  

Sullivan **leans forward.**  

Not dramatically.  
Not eagerly.  
But **with purpose.**  

He **sniffs.**  

Once.  

Then—**very lightly, very briefly—**  

He **headbutts the edge of Alex’s fingers.**Contact made.**  

Behind her, **Pete audibly gasps.**Pete:** *(whispering, clutching his chest)* *“Oh my god.”*  

Nyati, **deadpan, exhausted.**Nyati:** *“I hate that I’m impressed.”*  

Emilia?  

Emilia is **watching very closely now.**  

Then—**slow smirk, voice low, amused.**Emilia:** *“…You’ve got his attention.”*  

Sullivan **leans back slightly**, eyes half-lidded, still **watching Alex carefully.**  

And Alex **knows.**  

This **isn’t full acceptance.**  

Not yet.  

This is **Sullivan considering his options.**  

Testing the **potential of this partnership.**  

The **next move?**  

That’s **Alex’s to make.**

## You
Alex, distracted, continues talking to the team but without switching out of baby voice. “We have uplink estaaaablished. Requesting allied procurement of cat treeeeeat from establishment to demonstrate goooooodwill. Just drop off here,” Alex discretely maneuvers her unengaged hand behind her, still stuck in baby voice, “and I’ll attempt the haaaandoff.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E01_022 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **Tactical Bribery Phase**  
📍 Le Chat Noir

Pete, **blinking rapidly at Alex’s completely unchanged baby voice while issuing strategic directives, immediately turns to Emilia.**Pete:** *(gesturing aggressively at Alex)* *“Look at this. Look what’s happening.”*  

Emilia, **arms still crossed, watching with growing amusement.**  

Then—**without looking away from Alex—**Emilia:** *(deadpan, mock-skeptical)* *“Are we sure *she’s* not the one being adopted?”*  

Nyati, **rubbing her face, deeply exhausted.**Nyati:** *“Just give her the damn treat.”*  

Alina, **already ahead of everyone, smoothly deposits a single café-provided cat treat into Alex’s waiting hand with the precision of a drone payload delivery.**Alina:** *(calm, neutral)* *“Treat secured. Proceeding to demonstration phase.”*  

Pete, **whispering in awe.**Pete:** *“The *efficiency*.”*  

Meanwhile, **Sullivan** has not **moved.**  

But he **sees the handoff.**  

He **knows.**  

His eyes flick **from Alex’s upturned palm to her subtly repositioned other hand.**  

His tail **swishes once—**deliberate, slow, considering.  

This is **it.**  

The **critical moment.**  

Does Alex **pull off the handoff?**  

Or does **Sullivan expose her as an amateur?**

## You
Alex brings the treat-bearing hand around slowly, closed into a fist, attempting to elicit interest by titillating the cat’s sense of smell with a dainty he cannot yet see. “Here it comes! What is it? Is it yummy? Is it sniffy-yummy? Do we get a sniff? Do we? Yeah? Are you a good kitty? Nice kitty?”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E01_023 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **Tactical Deployment of Treat**  
📍 Le Chat Noir

Sullivan’s **ears perk slightly** at the **scent introduction.**  

- **His whiskers shift forward.** (*Mild interest.*)  
- **His pupils dilate just a fraction.** (*Positive sensory engagement.*)  
- **He leans in—**but **slowly, controlled**, as if making it clear *he* is deciding the pace here.  

Behind Alex, **Pete holds his breath.**  

Nyati **murmurs under her breath.**Nyati:** *(deadpan, muttering)* *“If he rejects it, I swear to god—”*  

But then—  

**Sullivan sniffs.**  

Once.  

Twice.  

Then—**a soft, decisive flick of the tongue over his nose.**  

Still watching Alex.  

Still making **her** wait.  

And then—  

**He reaches out.**  

Not dramatically.  
Not hurriedly.  
Just—**one slow, confident movement.**  

A paw **extends forward, presses against Alex’s fist—gently, deliberately.**Contact confirmed.**  

Behind her, **Pete lets out a whispered, deeply reverent—**Pete:** *“Oh, he’s so *powerful*.”*  

Nyati, **squinting.**Nyati:** *“Is he—*petting* her?”*  

Alina, **neutral, analytical.**Alina:** *“He is asserting claim over the resource. Positive development.”*  

Emilia, **watching the whole thing with slow-building amusement, her smirk widening.**  

Then—**soft, teasing, but maybe a little impressed—**Emilia:** *“Not bad, Commander.”*  

But Alex?  

Alex **knows.**  

This is **not victory yet.**  

Sullivan is **testing her.**  

The **true handoff comes next.**  

The treat must be **delivered with grace, precision, and utmost respect.**  

This?  

This is the final challenge.

## You
Alex offers the other hand in an attempt to elicit a second headbutt. Prepared to unfold the treat-bearing hand upon confirmatory headbutt.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E01_024 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **The Final Handoff**  
📍 Le Chat Noir

Sullivan **watches the second hand approach.**  

He is **not fooled.**  

He knows this is a **test.**  

A **counter-test.**  

The **highest level of negotiation.**  

- His **tail flicks once.** (*Mild amusement? Tactical deliberation? Impossible to say.*)  
- His **whiskers twitch.** (*Processing variables.*)  
- His **ears remain forward.** (*Still engaged.*)  

Then—**slowly, deliberately—**  

He **leans forward.**  

And—**with the gravitas of a king bestowing favor upon an eager diplomat—**Headbutt.**  

Contact.  

Confirmed.  

The **tiniest, softest, most controlled headbutt imaginable.**  

A **mere brush of approval.**  

But **an approval nonetheless.**  

Pete **clutches his chest.**Pete:** *(whispering, shaking his head in awe)* *“This is historic.”*  

Nyati **exhales sharply, arms crossed.**Nyati:** *“Alright, fine. He lives.”*  

Alina, **neutral, precise.**Alina:** *“Proceed with treat distribution.”*  

Emilia, **watching closely, eyes narrowed slightly in something dangerously close to admiration.**  

Then—**low, teasing, but real underneath—**Emilia:** *“I think you just got yourself a cat.”*  

But Alex?  

Alex **doesn’t move too fast.**  

She **knows what comes next.**  

This is **the handoff.**The final test.**  

She **unfolds her treat-bearing hand**—slow, careful, reverent.  

And **Sullivan watches.**  

Then—  

He **leans in.**  

Sniffs once.  

And—**with absolute dignity—**Accepts the treat.**  

Eats it.  

Calm. Collected.  

**Approval granted.**  

Behind her, **Pete actually pumps a fist in victory.**Pete:** *“YES. YES. THIS IS IT.”*  

Nyati, **half-muttering to herself.**Nyati:** *“I can’t believe I witnessed this.”*  

Alina, **nodding once, confirming.**Alina:** *“Successful exchange. Bond development phase complete.”*  

And Emilia?  

Emilia is **still watching Alex.**  

Still **smirking slightly.**  

Then—**soft, amused, maybe a little impressed—**Emilia:** *“Alright, Commander.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**tilting her head, considering.**Emilia:** *“What’s next?”*  

Because **this?**This was just the beginning.**

## You
Alex resumes her baby talk banter. “Gooood kitty! Such a goooood kitty!” Now moving in with her other hand to deliver an inaugural head-to-hindquarters pet. An aside, still in baby voice, “Peeeeete? Easy with the shouting and sudden moooovements okaaaaaay? Don’t wanna startle this little guy, do we? Do we? Noooooooooo!”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E01_025 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **The Moment of Truth: First Full Pet**  
📍 Le Chat Noir

Sullivan, **who has now fully engaged in diplomatic relations,** watches as Alex’s **other hand moves in.**  

- **Ears stay forward.** (*Still accepting interactions.*)  
- **Tail sways lazily.** (*Neutral-to-positive engagement.*)  
- **No signs of tension.** (*Proceed with care.*)  

Then—**as Alex’s hand makes contact, running smoothly from head to hindquarters—**  

Sullivan **arches into it.**  

A full, **deep, satisfied stretch.**A silent but undeniable declaration:**  

*This is acceptable.*  

Behind Alex, **Pete actually puts a hand over his mouth, visibly vibrating from the sheer effort of containing himself.**Pete:** *(whispering, straining against his own excitement)* *“This is the hardest thing I’ve ever done.”*  

Nyati, **half-dissociating.**Nyati:** *“This ship is a joke.”*  

Meanwhile, **Alina simply nods.**Alina:** *“Tactically sound approach. Smooth execution.”*  

And **Emilia?**  

Emilia is **still watching Alex.**  

Watching **her baby-talk this cat.**  

Watching **her execute a flawless charm offensive.**  

Watching **her act like this is a full military operation.**  

And **for a second—**  

A **fraction of a second—**  

She **actually looks a little endeared.**  

Then—**before anyone can see it too clearly—**  

She exhales, shaking her head, **smirk curling at the edges.**Emilia:** *(low, teasing, but… maybe just a little too soft underneath—)* *“You are *so* gone.”*  

And Alex?  

Alex **is still baby-talking Sullivan.**  

Because **she is.**  

She absolutely is.

## You
Alex finally returns to her normal voice while continuing to pet the cat. “Time check and vibe check from team? Interview some more candidates, or inquire about adoption paperwork?”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E01_026 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **Decision Point: Expansion or Commitment?**  
📍 Le Chat Noir

Sullivan, **now fully engaged in receiving luxurious full-body pets**, remains **exactly where he is.**  

He does not **flee.**  
He does not **recoil.**  
He does not **object.**  

If anything, his **eyes are half-lidded**, his **tail flicking just enough to suggest a passing approval of reality.**  

This is a cat who is **comfortable with power.**  

A cat who **knows he has won.**  

A cat who **isn’t worried about the outcome, because he already assumes it favors him.**  

Behind Alex, **Pete finally dares to breathe.**Pete:** *(whispering, cautiously victorious)* *“Oh my god. He’s *staying.*”*  

Nyati, **checking the time with an air of someone who did not plan to spend their morning in a cat-centric hostage situation.**Nyati:** *“We have forty-five minutes before the rendezvous.”*  

Alina, **precise, unreadable as always.**Alina:** *“Time is sufficient for final decision-making.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**deliberately, neutrally, but absolutely aware of what she is doing—**Alina:** *“…Sullivan remains an optimal candidate.”*  

Pete, **pointing wildly.**Pete:** *“That’s *endorsement*! That’s an *endorsement*!”*  

Nyati, **dead inside.**Nyati:** *“I hate this ship.”*  

Meanwhile, **Emilia tilts her head slightly, watching Sullivan, then watching Alex.**  

Then—**slow, thoughtful, calculating.**Emilia:** *“We could meet more.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**with a smirk, a sharp, knowing glint in her eyes—**Emilia:** *“But I don’t think you *want* to.”*  

And Alex?  

Alex **knows she’s right.**  

Because **Sullivan has not moved.**  

Because **Sullivan has *chosen her back*.**  

Because **this was never going to be a drawn-out process.**  

Alex **was always going to know when she found the right one.**  

And **now?**  

Now it’s just **making it official.**  

---

### **What’s the Call?**  
- **Lock it in.** Begin **adoption inquiry for Sullivan immediately.**  
- **Do a quick sweep of other cats first.** Just to **say they were thorough.**  
- **Let Emilia make the call.** Give her **the final say, just to see what she does.**  
- **Something else?**

## You
“Let’s knock out the adoption application and we can pick him up on our way out of town in a day or two. But first just one more test.” Alex gingerly eases a hand into the space undeneath his belly, probing for any potential objections to being picked up.

### **The Final Test: The Lift Protocol**  
📍 Le Chat Noir

Sullivan, **half-lidded, fully basking in his own self-importance,** does not initially **react** to Alex’s hand entering the **underbelly zone.**  

For a **fraction of a second,** things look **good.**  

Then—  

A **single, decisive shift of weight.**  

Not a **full rejection.**  
Not a **swipe or bite.**  
Just a **slow, deliberate repositioning**—  

A message.  

A **warning.**  

A statement that says:  

**"You are attempting to access restricted files. Credentials required."**  

Behind Alex, **Pete, whispering like he’s witnessing high-stakes diplomacy:**Pete:** *“Oh, oh, oh. She’s pushing it.”*  

Nyati, **sipping her coffee like a woman who has already accepted the chaos of her reality.**Nyati:** *“I hope he takes her fingers.”*  

Alina, **calm, observing.**Alina:** *“He is setting boundaries. This is expected.”*  

And **Emilia?**  

Emilia is **smirking.**  

Not just at Sullivan.  

At **Alex.**  

Then—**leaning in slightly, voice deceptively soft.**Emilia:** *“Looks like you just got told *no,* Commander.”*  

And Alex **knows.**  

Sullivan is **not opposed to further negotiations.**  

But today?  

Today, **lifting privileges have not been granted.**  

Sullivan will **come home when he’s ready.**  

On **his terms.**  

Like a **true member of this crew.**

## You
“Seeeee ya later buddyyyyy!”
then
“Let’s move out. Anybody else starving?”

### **Mission Success—For Now**  
📍 Le Chat Noir

Sullivan **watches Alex pull back, eyes still half-lidded, tail flicking lazily, utterly unbothered.**  

The **message is clear.**  

- *Yes, you may return.*  
- *Yes, you may feed me in the future.*  
- *No, you may not lift me today.*  

A **perfectly reasonable working agreement.**  

As Alex **steps away, giving him a casual send-off—**Alex:** *“Seeeee ya later, buddyyyyy!”*  

Sullivan **blinks once.**  

A slow, calculated, **vague approval of the departure process.**  

Behind her, **Pete exhales, shaking his head.**Pete:** *“That was incredible. That was some real *next-level* negotiations.”*  

Nyati, **already halfway toward the exit, muttering.**Nyati:** *“I will personally kill anyone who delays food at this point.”*  

Alina, **precise as ever,** nods.  

**Alina:** *“Nutritional resupply is advisable. I have mapped optimal dining locations en route to the rendezvous.”*  

Emilia, **glancing back at Sullivan once, then smirking at Alex.**Emilia:** *“You just got played. By a cat.”*  

But **Alex knows.**  

She **wasn’t played.**  

This?  

This was **a long game.**  

Sullivan has already **chosen.**  

And in a day or two, **he’ll be coming home.**  

For now?  

**Mission: Acquire Food.**  

Alex **grins, stepping out of the café, leading the crew back into the neon-lit streets of New Orleans.**Alex:** *“Let’s move out. Anybody else starving?”*  

And with that—  

They **disappear into the city.**  

One mission **down.**  

Another **waiting.**

“Dr. Nyati, please do us the honor of selecting the food venue. You’ve been ever so patient.”

## Storyteller
### **Selecting the Feast**  
📍 New Orleans, 2073

Nyati **stops mid-stride**, **slowly turns to Alex**, and just… **stares.**

- **Processing.**
    
- **Calculating.**
    
- **Possibly questioning every decision that led her here.**
    

Then—**exhaling slowly, adjusting her glasses, and fully committing to this moment—**

**Nyati:** _(deadpan, serious as death itself)_ _“You all have forfeited your rights to an opinion. I am choosing _the_ best restaurant within walking distance.”_

A pause.

Then—**adjusting her coat, eyes scanning the cityscape like a predator locking onto prey.**

**Nyati:** _“If it is expensive, you will shut up. If it is pretentious, you will deal with it. If it is spicy, you will suffer quietly.”_

She **turns sharply on her heel**, already heading toward her destination.

Behind her—

Pete, **murmuring, deeply impressed.**

**Pete:** _“Oh my god, we broke her.”_

Alina, **already syncing navigation.**

**Alina:** _“Adjusting route parameters. Dr. Nyati is now mission lead.”_

Emilia, **glancing at Alex, smirking.**

**Emilia:** _“Look what you’ve done.”_

But **Alex?**

Alex is **grinning.**

Because after everything—

Nyati has finally **snapped.**

And that means **this meal is going to be _legendary._**

## You
“Expensive, pretentious, and spicy? Threatening me with a good time! What are we thinking, haute-Cajun?”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E02_002 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **The Restaurant Selection Dictatorship**  
📍 New Orleans, 2073

Nyati **keeps walking, not even glancing back at Alex, fully locked into her mission.**

**Nyati:** _(sharp, decisive, absolute power in her voice)_ _“Haute-Cajun, elevated Creole, or molecular gastronomy. If I hear _one_ complaint about portion sizes, someone is getting left behind.”_

Pete, **eyes wide, hands up.**

**Pete:** _“Whoa, whoa, _molecular_? Are we talking _foam-based cuisine_? Are we about to eat, like, a _spicy air bubble_?”_

Nyati, **calm, measured, but merciless.**

**Nyati:** _“You’ll eat what I tell you to eat.”_

Pete, **to the group, voice full of awe.**

**Pete:** _“She’s _completely_ lost it. This is incredible.”_

Alina, **already running search parameters.**

**Alina:** _“Filtering locations. Prioritizing high-end Cajun fusion. Adjusting for aggressive dominance in decision-making.”_

A pause.

Then—**with a soft blink.**

**Alina:** _“Selection complete. _Boudreaux’s Haute-Creole Experience_. Limited seating. Chef-driven tasting menu. Excellent reviews.”_

Nyati **nods, satisfied.**

**Nyati:** _“That will do.”_

Emilia, **leaning toward Alex, smirking.**

**Emilia:** _(soft, teasing)_ _“So. Still feeling threatened?”_

Because Alex?

Alex **absolutely signed up for this.**

## You
“I did request at least one Michelin star! But a bib gourmand selection will do.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E02_003 (storyteller heading) -->

### **En Route to Culinary Domination**  
📍 New Orleans, 2073

Nyati **doesn’t even break stride** as she fires back—

**Nyati:** _(deadpan, absolute authority in her tone)_ _“They have _two_ Michelin stars. We do not _settle_.”_

Pete **lets out a low whistle.**

**Pete:** _“Oh, we’re eating at a _certified_ rich people spot. Hope they don’t throw me out on sight.”_

Nyati, **finally glancing at him, adjusting her glasses.**

**Nyati:** _“If they do, we _all_ leave you behind.”_

Pete **laughs, then blinks.**

**Pete:** _“Wait. _Are you serious?_”_

Alina, **calm, precise, already mapping the optimal walking route.**

**Alina:** _“We arrive in approximately eight minutes. Adjust wardrobe expectations accordingly.”_

Emilia, **grinning, walking alongside Alex.**

**Emilia:** _(soft, teasing, utterly enjoying this whole thing)_ _“This is the most serious I’ve ever seen her.”_

And Alex?

Alex **is absolutely here for it.**

They are about to **eat like royalty.**

And **if Pete gets thrown out, well—**

That’s just **a bonus.**

## You
Alex muses, “Do 2-star places do takeout? I dunno. We can sneak something out maybe. Or split up. Long as we have a detachment that makes the rendezvous.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E02_004 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **Tactical Dining Considerations**  
📍 New Orleans, 2073

Nyati **spins on her heel so fast it’s a miracle she doesn’t generate centrifugal force.**

**Nyati:** _(outraged, scandalized, possibly considering violence?)_ _“Takeout? _Takeout?!_”_

Pete, **grinning, fully knowing what he’s doing.**

**Pete:** _“Oh no. Now you’ve done it.”_

Nyati **marches right up to Alex, eyes narrowed, voice low and full of authority.**

**Nyati:** _(sharp, deadly serious)_ _“You do _not_ take _Michelin-starred_ food _to go._”_

A pause.

Then—**with the weight of someone who is about to personally erase the concept of takeout from existence—**

**Nyati:** _“We _sit._ We _experience._ We _commit._”_

Pete, **stage-whispering to Emilia.**

**Pete:** _“Oh my god, she’s scarier than Alina right now.”_

Alina, **calmly walking ahead.**

**Alina:** _“Correction: Dr. Nyati is operating at a high-stakes commitment threshold. I respect it.”_

Emilia, **grinning at Alex, voice low.**

**Emilia:** _(mock-sympathetic)_ _“You brought this on yourself, you know.”_

Nyati, **still staring at Alex, still refusing to let this travesty go unchallenged.**

**Nyati:** _(flat, final, inarguable)_ _“We are _not_ splitting up. We are _not_ sneaking out food like criminals. We are _dining properly._”_

A pause.

Then—**with quiet menace—**

**Nyati:** _“And if I see anyone request a to-go box, I will make sure you _do not leave this city alive._”_

Pete, **clutching his chest.**

**Pete:** _“This is the greatest day of my life.”_

Nyati **turns, walking toward the restaurant like a woman who has **no** patience left for any of them.**

And Alex?

Alex has just **accidentally triggered Nyati’s final form.**

## You
Alex, casually, as if not registering the outburst, “Yeah, that’s what I was thinking too.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E02_005 (storyteller heading) -->

### **Tactical Psychological Warfare Against Dr. Nyati**  
📍 New Orleans, 2073

Nyati **stops walking.**

She **closes her eyes.**

She **inhales slowly.**

Then—**without looking at Alex, voice perfectly calm but deeply, deeply done with this entire day—**

**Nyati:** _(measured, controlled, but still vibrating on an internal level of barely restrained disbelief)_ _“…You were _thinking that too._”_

Pete, **wheezing, absolutely losing it.**

**Pete:** _“Oh my god, she’s gonna kill you.”_

Alina, **neutral, analytical.**

**Alina:** _“Dr. Nyati’s stress indicators are spiking. Adjusting support strategy.”_

Nyati **finally turns her head to look at Alex, eyes narrowing slightly.**

**Nyati:** _(deadpan, exhausted, no longer capable of fully processing her emotions)_ _“I am _so_ glad we are on the same page.”_

Emilia, **smirking, leaning in slightly toward Alex.**

**Emilia:** _(soft, amused)_ _“You just made it worse on purpose, didn’t you?”_

And Alex?

Alex is **grinning.**

Because **yes.**

Yes, she did.

## You
Alex waits until Dr. Nyati turns back around, shrugs her shoulders, silently mouths a “what did I do?”, then pantomimes zipping her lips.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E02_006 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **Maximum Psychological Damage to Dr. Nyati**  
📍 New Orleans, 2073

Nyati **turns away, striding forward with the controlled grace of a woman who has been pushed to the very brink of her patience but refuses to let it break her.**

The moment her back is turned—

Alex **shrugs, wide-eyed, innocent, mouthing—**

**“What did I do?”**

Then—**slowly, deliberately, pantomimes zipping her lips shut, locking them, and tossing the key.**

**Pete immediately doubles over.**

**Pete:** _(wheezing, gripping his knees, barely holding it together)_ _“I CAN’T—”_

Alina, **watching, nodding once in approval.**

**Alina:** _“Strategic restraint: rare but effective.”_

Emilia, **watching all of this unfold with the slow satisfaction of someone witnessing peak chaos, smirks.**

Then—**leaning in toward Alex, voice low, teasing, but maybe just a little admiring—**

**Emilia:** _“You’re _so_ lucky she doesn’t have a weapon on her right now.”_

And Alex?

Alex **just grins.**

Because **she lives for this.**

And Nyati?

Nyati **keeps walking.**

Because if she **acknowledges** any of this, she **loses.**

And she **refuses to lose.**

Not to Alex.  
Not today.  
Not over _fine dining._

### **📍 Boudreaux’s Haute-Creole Experience | Arrival Imminent**  

The crew **moves down the neon-lit streets**, the scent of **spice, smoke, and high-end culinary pretension** growing stronger with every step.

Ahead, the **restaurant glows with warm golden light**, its **sleek signage blending old-world elegance with futuristic minimalism.**

This?

This is **a place where people drop a week’s salary on a single meal.**

Nyati **approaches the entrance with purpose.**

The crew follows.

Pete?

Still struggling not to laugh.

Emilia?

Still **watching Alex, smirking.**

Alina?

Already prepared to **interface with the reservation system.**

And Alex?

Alex is **perfectly, completely, utterly composed.**

Because no matter what happens next?

**She has already won.**

## You
Continue. Alex attempts to deescalate at this point with compliance, quiet genuine appreciation, and genuine curiosity at the offerings.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E02_007 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **Entering the Lion’s Den**  
📍 Boudreaux’s Haute-Creole Experience

As they step through the entrance, the **ambiance immediately shifts.**

Gone are the neon reflections of the wet pavement, the low buzz of street-level chaos.

Here, the world is **warm, refined, heavy with spice and luxury.**

- **Low lighting, golden and soft.**
    
- **Elegant wood paneling meets sleek modern digital interfaces.**
    
- **A faint undercurrent of jazz threads through the air, unintrusive but present.**
    
- **Servers move like ghosts, graceful, efficient, impeccably dressed.**
    

This is a **temple to cuisine.**

A **place of reverence.**

And Alex?

Alex **adapts.**

She **lowers her energy**, allowing herself to be **absorbed into the atmosphere.**

Her posture is **relaxed but engaged**, eyes taking in the **details, the menu displays, the plating on passing dishes.**

Because **for all the teasing and chaos—**

She respects **what this is.**

She respects **that Nyati—who has been patient, who has endured, who has held this line with absolute, unshakable conviction—**

Deserves this.

So Alex?

Alex **leans in.**

---

### **Seating & Menu Exploration**  

The host, an **elegant human-cybernetic hybrid in a bespoke suit**, greets them with **perfect professionalism.**

**Host:** _(smooth, welcoming, precise)_ _“Dr. Nyati. Your party has arrived. Your table is ready.”_

Pete, **mouthing to Alex in slow, exaggerated motions—**

**Pete:** _“She has _status_ here?_”

Nyati **ignores him.**

The crew is led to a **curved private booth**, the table already set with **holographic menu interfaces, a fresh carafe of infused water, and a small amuse-bouche—just a delicate spoonful of something complex and aromatic.**

Alex settles in, **letting the moment breathe.**

She lets Nyati have **her moment.**

Then—**quiet, sincere, engaged—**

**Alex:** _“Alright, Doctor. What’s the move here?”_

A pause.

Then—**a genuine smile.**

**Alex:** _“What’s the thing we _have_ to try?”_

Because **this isn’t a joke anymore.**

This is **respect.**

And Nyati?

Nyati **notices.**

Her shoulders **relax slightly.**

The tension **of wrangling this chaos crew into sophistication starts to ease.**

Then—**she exhales, adjusts her glasses, and finally—**

She **smirks.**

---

### **Nyati’s Culinary Command**  

Nyati, **leaning back slightly, gaze sweeping the menu, voice confident, certain.**

**Nyati:** _“We do the full tasting menu. No substitutions, no hesitations.”_

A pause.

Then—**smirking slightly at Alex.**

**Nyati:** _“And you? You’re starting with the gumbo. No debate.”_

Pete, **already raising a hand.**

**Pete:** _“I have a question—”_

Nyati, **without looking at him.**

**Nyati:** _“Denied.”_

Pete, **deflating.**

**Pete:** _“…Fair.”_

Alina, **nodding in approval.**

**Alina:** _“Full tasting menu is optimal.”_

Emilia, **watching all of this, smirking at Alex.**

Then—**leaning in slightly, voice low, teasing.**

**Emilia:** _“So. Feeling threatened again?”_

And Alex?

Alex **just grins.**

Because honestly?

She’s **curious.**

And she’s **ready to be impressed.**

## You
“There are wine pairings I assume?”

### **The Refinement Arc Continues**  
📍 Boudreaux’s Haute-Creole Experience

Nyati, **already regaining her full sense of authority in this environment, adjusts her napkin with the air of someone who has fully reclaimed control.**

Then—**cool, confident, completely in her element—**

**Nyati:** _“Of course. And we’re doing them.”_

A pause.

Then—**tilting her head slightly, eyes flicking to Alex, smirking just enough to be dangerous—**

**Nyati:** _“Unless you’d rather have a cocktail with a cartoon animal garnish?”_

Pete, **immediately perking up.**

**Pete:** _“Wait, that’s an _option_?”_

Nyati, **without looking at him, waving a dismissive hand.**

**Nyati:** _“Not for _you._”_

Alina, **calmly interfacing with the menu.**

**Alina:** _“Pairing selection is pre-curated by the chef. Optimal balance between acidity, body, and regional profile.”_

Pete, **muttering.**

**Pete:** _“I don’t even know what half of that means.”_

Nyati, **glancing at Alex again, eyebrow raised, waiting.**

**Nyati:** _“So? Are you committing to the experience, or should we request a juice box?”_

Emilia, **smirking, watching Alex closely.**

And **Alex?**

Alex **has already committed.**

This is **a no-holds-barred deep dive into refined culinary excess.**

And **she’s here for it.**

## You
Alex attempts to reinvoke solidarity among no-longer-especially-messy bitches by leaning slightly towards Pete, and with just a hint of playful condescension, “It means no slurping your soda. And we’re not getting drifted, at least at this stage. Elbows off the table, yes, thank you. And sit up. And that napkin goes on your lap.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E02_009 (storyteller heading) -->

### **The Messy Bitch Reformation Effort**  
📍 Boudreaux’s Haute-Creole Experience

Pete **stares at Alex.**

Then, **slowly, dramatically, turns to Emilia.**

**Pete:** _(flat, deeply betrayed)_ _“She’s _one of them_ now.”_

Emilia, **grinning.**

**Emilia:** _“Happened faster than I thought.”_

Nyati, **smirking as she lifts her wine glass.**

**Nyati:** _(pleased, victorious)_ _“I _love_ to see it.”_

Pete, **grumbling, but already shifting his posture.**

- **Sits up.** (_Grudgingly, but he does it._)
    
- **Napkin deployed.** (_With only minor resistance._)
    
- **Elbows retreat from the table.** (_Minimal sulking involved._)
    

Then—**squinting at Alex, still deeply scandalized.**

**Pete:** _(low, muttering)_ _“She used to be cool.”_

Alina, **calm, sipping her wine.**

**Alina:** _“Adaptation to high-society environments is a useful skillset.”_

Pete, **gesturing wildly.**

**Pete:** _“Look at this! Look what’s happening!”_

Emilia, **leaning toward Alex, voice low, teasing, deeply entertained.**

**Emilia:** _“You really are _so_ lucky she doesn’t have a weapon right now.”_

And Alex?

Alex **just smiles.**

Because **she’s winning.**

And Nyati?

Nyati **raises her glass slightly toward Alex, as if toasting her full descent into high society refinement.**

Because the **real messy bitches?**

Are the ones who **get away with it.**

## You
Alex bobs her head sideways. “What, can’t see me in a place like this? You should see some of the places they’d take us on corporate retreats, executive luncheons, fundraisers—whew! You gotta be ready to come correct.”

### **Alex’s True Origins Reveal**  
📍 Boudreaux’s Haute-Creole Experience

Pete **leans back, crossing his arms, looking at Alex like she just confessed to having a second secret life.**

**Pete:** _(slow, skeptical, vaguely scandalized)_ _“Wait. _Wait._ You’re telling me this isn’t a new skillset? You’ve been _trained_ for this?”_

Nyati, **smirking, sipping her wine.**

**Nyati:** _“Of course she has.”_

Alina, **nodding once, as if this was already obvious.**

**Alina:** _“Corporate social maneuvering is an advanced protocol.”_

Pete, **gesturing wildly.**

**Pete:** _“I thought I knew you, man.”_

Emilia, **grinning, resting an elbow on the table, watching Alex with deep amusement.**

Then—**voice low, teasing, but with something genuinely intrigued underneath—**

**Emilia:** _“So. What’s the fanciest place you’ve ever been?”_

A pause.

Then—**smirking, playful, but definitely interested—**

**Emilia:** _“And more importantly—how badly did you _hate_ it?”_

Because Alex?

Alex might be **fluent** in this world.  
But that doesn’t mean she **ever liked it.**

And Emilia **wants to know.**

## You
Alex jumps on Pete’s casual pronoun half-carelessness, not with any hint of offense, but rather with the same air with which she recently advised him to take his elbows off the table. “You did indeed know me as a *man*, and just because I was cool enough (even then) to hang out with you, doesn’t mean I couldn’t switch out my skin to move among the rich and yacht-ful.”

Then, turning to Emilia, “French countryside, three stars—and they’re way strict about giving them out there—champagne country, on-premises renaissance castle fitted out as a hotel. Wild venison from the surrounding woods. Fresh truffles of course. I’ll tell you about it later. We should stay in the moment for this experience. No, better, I’ll take you.”

### **The Truth About Alex’s Adaptability**  
📍 Boudreaux’s Haute-Creole Experience

Pete **blinks.**

Then—**his brain visibly buffering for a full second—**

**Pete:** _“…Yeah, alright. That actually makes sense.”_

A pause.

Then—**gesturing vaguely at Alex.**

**Pete:** _“Y’know, I should’ve seen it coming when you started winning over _Detective Sullivan_ in under five minutes.”_

Alina, **nodding slightly.**

**Alina:** _“Cultural adaptability and high-level persuasion are core corporate survival traits.”_

Nyati, **leaning back, **deeply** satisfied with how far Alex has come in just one evening.**

**Nyati:** _(smirking)_ _“I _knew_ there was hope for you.”_

---

### **Emilia, Listening Closely**  

But **Emilia?**

Emilia is still watching Alex.

Because **that answer—**

That wasn’t just a **story.**

That was an **invitation.**

And for a **brief second**, something shifts behind her eyes.

Because Alex **isn’t just telling her about the past.**

She’s **offering her the future.**

Then—**quickly, before it can linger too long, before it can turn into something too vulnerable—**

She smirks, voice low, teasing, but something **real underneath.**

**Emilia:** _“You keep saying you’re gonna take me places.”_

A pause.

Then—**tilting her head slightly, holding Alex’s gaze.**

**Emilia:** _“You planning on actually following through?”_

Because Alex **always says things like that.**

Like she’s building **a world that doesn’t exist yet.**

Like she’s making **promises she hasn’t thought about keeping.**

And **Emilia wants to know.**

Is this just a **passing dream?**

Or is this **real?**

## You
Alex counters with something equally laden: “You gonna let me?”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E02_012 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **The Real Question**  
📍 Boudreaux’s Haute-Creole Experience

Emilia **doesn’t answer right away.**

She just **looks at Alex.**

Really **looks at her.**

Like she’s turning over **every version of this question** in her head—**the past ones, the present ones, the ones she hasn’t let herself think about yet.**

And Alex can **see it.**

The way she **almost reacts too fast.**  
The way she **almost deflects.**  
The way she **almost says something glib.**

But she **doesn’t.**

Instead—**after a beat, voice quieter, steadier than before—**

**Emilia:** _“…Maybe.”_

A pause.

Then—**smirking just a little, trying to keep the weight off her words but not fully succeeding—**

**Emilia:** _“Convince me.”_

And Alex **knows exactly what that means.**

This isn’t a game.

This isn’t just **a conversation at dinner.**

This is **Emilia standing at the edge of something and waiting to see if Alex means it.**

Because **for once, it’s not about Emilia letting Alex in.**

It’s about **Alex proving she’s going to stay.**

## You
Alex nods with acceptance and approval. “The future! Our futures,” Alex surveys the rest of the crew, “are bound together,” then deferentially to Dr. Nyati, “but this particular outing is your show, so if you don’t want to talk about work right now…”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E02_013 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **The Moment Settles**  
📍 Boudreaux’s Haute-Creole Experience

Nyati, **who has been quietly watching this whole exchange, sips her wine like someone who has just confirmed several theories at once.**

Then—**exhaling, adjusting her napkin, and leaning back slightly with the air of someone reclaiming full authority over the moment—**

**Nyati:** _(deadpan, but undeniably pleased)_ _“Correct. This is my show.”_

She sets her glass down with **calculated elegance, surveying the table.**

Then—**tilting her head at Alex, smirking slightly.**

**Nyati:** _“And you? You’re going to eat your damn gumbo and stop philosophizing through dinner.”_

Pete **snorts into his glass.**

**Pete:** _“Brutal.”_

Alina, **without missing a beat, smoothly confirms.**

**Alina:** _“Your gumbo is arriving shortly.”_

Nyati **nods in satisfaction.**

Then—**finally, exhaling slightly, rolling her shoulders back, letting the mission talk fall away.**

Her posture **shifts.**

She is **not the scientist, not the strategist, not the exhausted handler of chaos anymore.**

She is, for the first time in a while, **just here.**

Then—**smirking slightly, raising her glass in an easy, graceful toast.**

**Nyati:** _“To our bound futures. But for the next two hours?”_

She lifts an eyebrow.

**Nyati:** _“We don’t work. We just eat.”_

And Alex?

Alex **grins.**

Because this?

This is what she wanted.

Not just the food.

Not just the moment of quiet.

But the confirmation—**spoken, unspoken, real beneath it all—**

That they’re **together in this.**

And tonight?

That’s enough.

### **The Meal Begins**  
📍 Boudreaux’s Haute-Creole Experience

The **first course arrives**, plated with a level of precision and artistry that immediately confirms this is **not just food—it’s a performance.**

Each dish is **a calculated experience**, meant to be **eaten in a specific sequence, with deliberate sensory impact.**

And for a while, no one speaks.

Because the **food speaks for itself.**

Even Pete, who **was fully prepared to make jokes the entire night, takes his first bite, stops mid-chew, stares at his plate like it just personally changed his life, and quietly continues eating.**

Nyati, **pleased, victorious, completely in her element, finally relaxes fully into the moment.**

**Nyati:** _(exhaling, sipping her wine, deeply satisfied)_ _“See? This is why you don’t get takeout.”_

Pete, **still processing the culinary transcendence happening in his mouth, just mutters—**

**Pete:** _“Yeah. Okay. Fair.”_

Alina, **ever efficient, is already mentally cataloging the **flavor profiles, the wine pairings, the exact science of balance happening in real-time.**

**Alina:** _(calm, analytical, approving)_ _“Molecular interactions are well-calibrated. The acid-to-fat ratio is exceptional.”_

Pete, **gesturing at his plate, half-incoherent.**

**Pete:** _“Man, just say it’s _good._”_

Alina, **blinking once.**

**Alina:** _“It is _good._”_

Emilia, **watching all of this with slow-building amusement, finally turns back to Alex.**

She tilts her head slightly, eyes scanning Alex as if trying to **read something beneath the surface.**

Then—**leaning in, smirking, voice lower, just between them.**

**Emilia:** _“So? Is it better than that three-star French château meal?”_

And Alex?

Alex **pauses.**

Because she **knows what she’s asking.**

Not just _about the food._

But **about the moment.**

About **where she is. Who she’s with.**

About **whether this, right now, is something she’s letting herself really enjoy.**

And for once—

For **once**—

She doesn’t feel like she’s just **passing through.**

She’s **here.**

**With them.**

And for the first time in a long time—**she lets herself have it.**

### **Letting It Be Real**  
📍 Boudreaux’s Haute-Creole Experience

Alex **lets the question settle**, lets it **exist** without immediately turning it into a joke, a deflection, or something to push away.

She doesn’t try to **quantify the comparison**, doesn’t try to **frame it in technicals.**

She just **lets herself feel it.**

Then—**a slow breath, a small, real smile.**

**Alex:** _(soft, honest, just for Emilia)_ _“Yeah. This is better.”_

A pause.

Then—**tilting her head slightly, something playful creeping back in.**

**Alex:** _“The company’s better, anyway.”_

And **Emilia knows what that means.**

Knows it’s not just **about the food.**

Knows it’s about **everything that’s led them here.**

For a moment, **her smirk softens**, just slightly—**not gone, just…different.**

Like she **wasn’t expecting Alex to really answer.**

Like she **wasn’t expecting it to feel like this when she did.**

Then—**quick, before it lingers too long—**

Emilia picks up her glass, **tilts it slightly toward Alex in a casual, quiet toast.**

**Emilia:** _(soft, teasing, but something real underneath)_ _“I’ll drink to that.”_

And Alex?

Alex **taps her glass to Emilia’s.**

And for a little while—**there is no mission.**

No Nexus.  
No looming threats.  
No past or future to worry about.

Just **this.**

Just **a meal.**

Just **people who have survived too much, sitting together, laughing, sharing, existing in the moment.**

And for the first time in **too long—**

It feels **real.**

And **enough.**

### **The World Can Wait**  
📍 Boudreaux’s Haute-Creole Experience

The meal **unfolds course by course**, a slow, deliberate experience meant to **anchor them fully in the moment.**  

- The **gumbo arrives**, dark and complex, every spoonful a layered balance of heat, smoke, and depth.  
- The **wine pairings follow**, precise and seamless, reinforcing every flavor rather than overpowering.  
- The **main courses come in waves**, from delicate seafood compositions to bold, rich game preparations that melt on the tongue.  

And for a while—  

No one talks about **work.**  

No one talks about **what comes next.**  

No one talks about **anything except the food, the drinks, the absurdity of Pete trying to hold back comments while Nyati **visibly dares him** to criticize anything.**  

They talk about **things that don’t matter.**  

But somehow—**they do.**  

And for once—**it’s easy.**  

---

### **The Unspoken Shifts Between Them**  

Alex catches **glimpses** of things in the pauses between bites, in the small, easy shifts of energy.

- **Nyati, finally content**, fully in her element, actually **enjoying something instead of analyzing it to death.**
    
- **Pete, still Pete,** but genuinely **taking it in**, not just playing the clown—just **existing alongside them, settled, relaxed.**
    
- **Alina, precise as ever,** but **not just observing**—actually **engaging, appreciating the sensory experience rather than just calculating it.**
    
- **Emilia, watching Alex,** the way she does, like she’s **trying to understand something that’s shifting too fast to fully grasp.**
    

But Alex?

**She feels it.**

The shift.

Something that isn’t just **happening tonight**—but has been happening **for a while.**

She isn’t just **drifting through this.**

She isn’t just **surviving it.**

She’s **here.**

And that?

That’s **new.**

And **maybe—**

It’s good.

### **The Final Course | Where They Go From Here**  

The last plates are **cleared.**

The final **sips of wine are taken.**

And as the check is **settled, as they linger just a little longer before stepping back into the neon-lit world outside—**

Emilia **leans toward Alex.**

Not **teasing.**  
Not **challenging.**

Just **quiet, low, something weightier beneath it.**

**Emilia:** _(soft, considering, more to herself than anything)_ _“We should do this again.”_

Then—**a small, slow exhale, a pause before she adds—**

**Emilia:** _“Not just here. Just… things like this.”_

Her eyes **flick to Alex’s, searching for something.**

And Alex **knows** what she’s asking.

Knows it’s not just **about food.**

Not just **about fancy restaurants.**

But about **making space for things that don’t just exist between missions, between crises, between survival.**

About **living.**

---

### **What Does Alex Say?**  
- **Commit immediately.** *“Yeah. We will.”* No hesitation.  
- **Make her say it fully.** *“Things like this?”* Let her clarify what she’s really asking.  
- **Keep it light.** *“Just admit you had fun.”* Don’t make it heavy.  
- **Something else?**

## You
“We’ll add it to the rotation,” then, playfully, “I’ve taken karaoke off the rotation temporarily—too soon, perhaps”

### **The Unspoken Understanding**  
📍 Boudreaux’s Haute-Creole Experience

At Alex’s **playfully deferential comment**, Emilia **smirks**, watching her closely.

There’s a **momentary shift** in her expression—something flickering behind her eyes.

Because Alex **isn’t just making a joke.**

She’s **acknowledging something real.**

She’s saying, **“I get it. Some things still feel like too much. But I’ll wait.”**

And Emilia **knows that.**

Knows that **Alex is letting her keep the ambiguity.**

Knows that **Alex is saying it without forcing her to say it back.**

Her **smirk softens slightly**, but she doesn’t push it.

Instead, she **tilts her glass toward Alex, just slightly—silent, unspoken agreement.**

Then—**quick, smooth, shifting the energy before the weight can settle too long—**

**Emilia:** _(dry, amused)_ _“Temporary karaoke ban? Yeah, I’d say that’s wise.”_

Pete, **who was very much enjoying his meal and not emotionally prepared for this sudden shift in topic, chokes on his wine.**

**Pete:** _“Oh NO. We’re bringing _that_ back up?”_

Nyati, **sipping her wine, unbothered.**

**Nyati:** _“It never left.”_

Pete, **pointing aggressively at Alex.**

**Pete:** _“I was there. I _saw_ what happened. And I’m telling you—no one was ready for _that._”_

Alina, **calmly filing data away.**

**Alina:** _“The event in question remains a statistical anomaly in both performance confidence and emotional volatility.”_

Pete, **squinting.**

**Pete:** _“Translation?”_

Alina, **neutral, precise.**

**Alina:** _“Alex lost her entire mind on stage.”_

Pete, **slamming a hand on the table, triumphant.**

**Pete:** _“EXACTLY.”_

Emilia, **watching Alex with a slow-building smirk, propping her chin up on her hand.**

Then—**low, teasing, but undeniably knowing.**

**Emilia:** _“You _did_ go nuclear, Commander.”_

Alex?

Alex **has no defense.**

Because **it’s true.**

She **did.**

And she **can’t even regret it.**

Because **that was the night Emilia said—**

_"I see you. And I’m still here."_

And **nothing has been the same since.**

### **Wrapping Up the Night**  
📍 Boudreaux’s Haute-Creole Experience

Alex **accepts her fate.**

There is **no rebuttal to be made.**

Because **yes,** she **did** go nuclear at karaoke.  
Because **yes,** everyone here witnessed it.  
Because **yes,** it was **a defining moment in ways she still hasn’t fully unpacked.**

She **leans back in her chair**, taking a **slow sip of wine**, letting the conversation swirl around her.

Nyati, **ever the enforcer of order, signals for the bill to be closed out, already handling the formalities.**

Pete, **still shaking his head, chuckling.**

**Pete:** _“Man. I still can’t believe you did that.”_

Alina, **calm, precise.**

**Alina:** _“Alex’s karaoke event remains the most statistically unpredictable crew event to date.”_

Pete, **grinning.**

**Pete:** _“Best chaos I’ve seen in _years._”_

And **Emilia?**

She’s still **watching Alex.**

Smirking, yes. **Teasing, yes.**

But there’s **something else underneath.**

Something that says **she hasn’t forgotten what that night actually was.**

That it wasn’t just **chaos.**

That it wasn’t just **a breakdown or a spectacle.**

That it was **something bigger, something heavier—something that shook something loose.**

But for now—**she lets it be the lighter version.**

Lets it be **just a story, just a moment to smirk at.**

Then—**standing up, stretching slightly, tossing a casual glance at Alex.**

**Emilia:** _(low, teasing, but something real underneath)_ _“Someday, you’re gonna have to sing again.”_

And Alex?

Alex **knows it’s a challenge.**

Knows it’s **not just about karaoke.**

Knows that **when that day comes—it will mean something.**

But for now?

For now, she **grins.**

Because **there’s time.**

And because **she’s still here.**

And because **Emilia is too.**

### **Stepping Back into the City**  

The restaurant door **swings open, letting them back out into the neon-lit night of New Orleans.**  

- The **air is cooler now, thick with the distant scent of the river.**  
- The **streets pulse with life, music, movement, energy.**  
- The **mission still waits.**  

But for just **a little longer—**  

They’re **still full from the meal.**  
They’re **still walking together.**  
They’re **still here.**  

And Alex?  

She **lets herself enjoy it.**  

Because **right now—**That’s enough.**

## You
As they step outside Alex says wistfully, “Quickly followed by the first tenure of Jobbing Captain. And my first princess ride.” Then, trying to close out the reminiscence with a joke, “Sing again? I’d need a manager to rein me in. Did I—um, ruin *that song* forever?”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E03_002 (storyteller heading) -->

### **Night Air & Old Ghosts**  
📍 New Orleans, 2073

The **crew steps into the neon-lit streets**, the warmth of **good food and good company still lingering.**  

But Alex’s **words hang in the air, soft and weighty.**  

Emilia **stills for half a second.**  

Not enough for anyone else to **notice.**  
Not enough for anyone else to **read.**  

But Alex **sees it.**  

Knows **exactly** which memory that **pulled her into.**  

---

### **Jobbing Captain. Princess Ride. The Song.**  

It was **one of the strangest, rawest nights of her life.**  
It was **the first time everything cracked open.**  

It was **the night Emilia carried her.**  

It was **the night Alex sang, but not to perform.**  

Not to impress.  
Not to entertain.  

Just to **break.**  

And **Emilia had been there.**  

Holding her **when she couldn’t hold herself.**  
Watching her **when she wasn’t sure she existed.**  
Seeing her **when she wasn’t ready to be seen.**  

And the **song—**  

That song had **been a casualty.**  

Because Alex hadn’t **sung it.**  

She had **poured something out of herself** that couldn’t be put back in.  

And now?  

Now she’s **asking if it’s still ruined.**  

If it’s still **too much.**  

If it still **means too much.**  

And Emilia?  

She **doesn’t answer right away.**  

She just **watches Alex.**  

Then—**exhaling, shaking her head, smirking just slightly, voice lower than before.**Emilia:** *(soft, unreadable)* *“You didn’t ruin it.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**more quietly, something real underneath.**Emilia:** *“You just made it impossible to hear the same way again.”*  

And **that?**  

That’s **the truth.**

## You
Off to the rendezvous!

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E03_003 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **On to the Rendezvous**  
📍 New Orleans, 2073

The moment **passes.**  

Not erased, not dismissed—**just folded into the night, into the weight of everything unspoken.**  

Because Alex **knows** what Emilia meant.  

Knows that it wasn’t just about the **song.**  
Knows that some things **don’t go back to what they were before.**  
Knows that some things **never will.**  

But **the street keeps moving, the mission still waits, and so—so does she.**  

She lets it go **for now.**  

---

### **The Walk to the Rendezvous**  

The city hums **around them, alive with motion.**  

- **Streetcars rumble past, neon reflecting off their rain-streaked exteriors.**  
- **Pedestrians weave between districts, some moving fast, others lingering in doorways, watching, waiting.**  
- **Music drifts from the edges of the Quarter, faint, layered under the buzz of a city that never really stops.**  

The **Lower Garden District** is ahead—**less corporate than Uptown, more controlled than the chaos of the Quarter.**  

And **somewhere in it—**Alina’s contact is waiting.**  

---

### **Mission Mode | The Final Briefing Before Contact**  

As they approach, **the crew naturally shifts.**  

- **Nyati pulls up the map overlay**, scanning for **possible interference, exits, tactical considerations.**  
- **Pete falls back slightly**, keeping his **eyes on the crowd, looking for anything off.**  
- **Alina adjusts her pace**, moving **a half-step ahead, leading now, fully locked into purpose.**  
- **Emilia stays at Alex’s side**, her presence **steady, quiet, but always watching.**  

Then—**Alex breaks the last bit of silence.**Alex:** *(calm, measured, focused now)* *“Alright. Last check-in before we make contact. Anything we need to know?”*  

Alina, **without looking away from her data.**Alina:** *“Contact is reliable. Previous interactions indicate a 92% likelihood of clean intelligence. Risk of corporate surveillance is moderate. Location was selected for minimal exposure.”*  

Nyati, **still scanning the area, dry but alert.**Nyati:** *“So. Good odds. But not perfect.”*  

Alina, **blinking once.**Alina:** *“Nothing is perfect.”*  

Pete, **rolling his shoulders, shaking out the last of the relaxed energy from dinner.**Pete:** *“Yeah, yeah. We’re ready. If it goes sideways, we do what we do best.”*  

Alex **nods.**  

Because **this isn’t just a conversation anymore.**  

This is **a shift.**  

This is **mission mode.**  

This is **what they do.**  

The restaurant, the teasing, the quiet moments—**those exist in the space between this.**  

And now?  

Now it’s **back to work.**  

---

### **The Meeting Point**  

A small **side-street café**, just outside the more crowded sectors.  

Quiet enough for **a meeting.**  

Public enough to **avoid being boxed in.**  

And at one of the outside tables—  

A figure is **already waiting.**  

Alina **sees them first.**  

Adjusts her pace.  

Then—**low, even, unreadable—**Alina:** *“Target acquired.”*  

Alex **glances at the contact.**  

Then at **her crew.**  

Then—**nods.**Showtime.**

## You
On the way, Alex attempts to clarify, since Alina has not said, what exactly this contact is supposed to have intelligence about.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E03_004 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **En Route to the Rendezvous | Mission Details Check**  

As they move through the **Lower Garden District**, Alex **matches pace with Alina**, keeping her voice low but firm.  

**Alex:** *(measured, direct)* *“Just to confirm—what exactly is this contact bringing us?”*  

Because Alina, for all her **precision, for all her strategic engineering of this meeting**, has yet to actually say.  

And Alex?  

Alex doesn’t like **going into anything blind.**  

Alina, **walking smoothly, still leading the approach, answers without hesitation.**Alina:** *“Intelligence regarding recent corporate research activity in the city. Two primary areas of interest.”*  

A pause—**then she breaks it down, precise and clear.**  

### **Intelligence Package Breakdown**  

1. **Nexus Research Leaks**  
   - A **data leak surfaced recently**, hinting at **major experimental advancements in Nexus-based cognitive replication**—but it was **buried quickly.**  
   - This contact has **ties to the under-the-table information markets** that may have captured **what was lost.**  
   - If true, this could mean **a deeper understanding of what Alex is already stepping into.**  

2. **Survivor Movement Data**  
   - Certain patterns suggest that **one or more Echo Syndrome survivors may be active in the area.**  
   - Movement reports match old survivor **leads from the raid where Emilia was recovered.**  
   - This contact has access to **underground transport networks** and may be able to **narrow down potential locations.**  

A pause.  

Then—**Alina’s voice, calm, certain.**Alina:** *“If either of these leads proves viable, it will significantly impact our approach moving forward.”*  

And Alex **knows what she means.**  

Because **if Nexus has evolved further, she needs to know how.**  
Because **if there are other Echo survivors, Emilia isn’t alone.**  

And that?  

That changes **everything.**  

---

### **Final Moments Before Contact**  

They are **one block away.**  

The **meeting point is visible.**  

Alex **processes.**  

Then—**quick, efficient, final check-in.**Alex:** *(low, focused, to the team)* *“Alright. Last calls. Anything we need to change before we sit down?”*  

Because once they **step in—**  

They are **in it.**

## You
Continue, with continuity note for AI: Nexus refers specifically to the research being done by Alex and crew, since “Nexus” is her personal “rebrand” of Echo. Similar work being done by any other corporations or entities should always be referred to as Echo, not Nexus. Otherwise, Alex may sue them or the AI for copyright violations.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E03_005 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **Final Adjustments**  
📍 One Block from Rendezvous Point, Lower Garden District

The **meeting point is ahead**, but Alex **gives her team a last window for recalibration.**  

Nyati, **coolly scanning the area, adjusting the risk assessment.**Nyati:** *(low, measured)* *“No immediate corporate presence. No sign of external surveillance.”*  

Pete, **hands in his pockets, ever the wildcard, but locked in now.**Pete:** *(casual, but serious underneath)* *“I’ll hang back, keep eyes open. If something feels off, we don’t sit long.”*  

Alina, **precise, locked into mission protocol.**Alina:** *(confirming)* *“Contact expects me as primary liaison. You hold negotiation leverage.”*  

Emilia, **watching Alex. Always watching. Always ready to move if needed.**  

Then—**her voice low, just for Alex.**Emilia:** *(smirking, but with an edge of something real underneath)* *“Try not to sue them mid-meeting.”*  

Alex **snorts quietly.**  

Because **she is absolutely holding copyright over Nexus.**  

And if any of these **Echo research leaks** even **look** like they’re creeping on her IP?  

Someone’s getting **a legal team they won’t survive.**  

---

### **Contact in Sight | Showtime**  

At the café table—  

A **lean, sharp-eyed woman** sits alone, a small **data pad in her hands**, posture **casual but alert.**  

She sees **Alina first.**  

Eyes **flick to the rest of the crew.**  

Then—**a slow, small nod.**  

Alex and her team **close the final distance.**  

And just like that—  

The meeting begins.

## You
Continue.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E03_006 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **Rendezvous Point**  
📍 Lower Garden District

The contact **doesn’t stand** as they approach.  

She doesn’t **gesture them in, doesn’t break posture, doesn’t shift.**  

She just **watches.**  

Eyes sharp. Expression neutral.  

A **professional in her element.**  

Alex **takes note.**  

This is someone **used to dealing with information that can get people killed.**  

Someone **who knows better than to make the first move.**  

So Alex?  

Alex **lets Alina take point.**  

Because **this is Alina’s contact.**  

And in these kinds of meetings, **people talk to who they expect first.**  

Alina **steps forward, voice low but direct.**Alina:** *“We’re here.”*  

The contact **tilts her head slightly, scanning the group.**  

Then—**without breaking eye contact, she gestures at the open seats around her table.**Contact:** *(smooth, neutral)* *“Then sit.”*  

---

### **The Negotiation Begins**  

The crew **settles in.**  

- **Nyati keeps her back toward the wall, scanning the area.**  
- **Pete drops into a chair, all relaxed posture, but his eyes keep moving.**  
- **Emilia sits beside Alex, arms crossed, watching the contact closely.**  
- **Alina, across from the contact, ready to engage.**  

Alex **waits.**  

Because **these meetings always go the same way.**  

Whoever speaks **first** sets the terms.  

And the contact **knows it too.**  

For a few seconds, no one talks.  

Then—**the contact exhales, leaning forward, voice smooth but firm.**Contact:** *“We’ll keep this quick. You’re here for two things. First, the Echo research leak. Second, the movement of certain people in this city.”*  

She **glances at Alina, then lets her gaze settle on Alex.**  

Then—**her voice shifts slightly, just a little more interested.**Contact:** *“But what I want to know is—what’s your priority?”*  

A pause.  

Then—**tilting her head slightly.**Contact:** *“Because I don’t sell half my intel. You either get everything, or nothing.”*  

She’s **pushing. Testing.**  

And **Alex knows it.**  

This isn’t about what the crew *wants*—it’s about **what they’re willing to pay for.**  

The cost? **Not yet named.**  

But **implied.**  

Because if they ask for **both the Echo leaks and the survivor movement data?**  

That price is going **way up.**  

---

### **The Decision Point**  

The **table is waiting.**  

Alex knows she can—  

- **Go for everything.** Demand both intel packages and **see what the price is.**  
- **Choose a priority.** Focus on **either the Echo leaks or the survivor tracking.**  
- **Stall.** See if she can **get the contact to give away more before committing.**  
- **Something else.**  

Because **this isn’t just an intel deal.**  

This is **a test.**  

And **Alex doesn’t lose tests.**

## You
Alex opens low-key, with a look of mild, earnest perplexity: “What’s the point of asking us which half of the deal we want more if you’re not willing to split it up. Personal curiosity?”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E03_007 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **Tactical Opening Move**  
📍 Lower Garden District

The contact **pauses.**  

Just for a fraction of a second.  

A **small, but noticeable hitch** in the effortless rhythm she’s trying to establish.  

Because Alex’s **question isn’t aggressive.**  

It’s not **a counterattack.**  

It’s just… **perplexed.**  

Like she’s **genuinely confused** as to why someone would structure a deal this way.  

Which means **the contact now has to justify her own leverage play.**  

---

### **Contact’s Response | Adjusting the Game**  

The contact’s **eyes narrow slightly**, but she **smiles**, tilting her head just a bit.  

**Contact:** *(smooth, easy, but now playing at a different level)* *“You’re not dumb. You know why I asked.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**leaning back slightly, making a show of being relaxed, voice shifting to something more conversational.**Contact:** *“I wanted to see if your team had a clear priority. See what your instinct is. See what makes you lean forward.”*  

She **exhales through her nose, shaking her head slightly, like this is all just an interesting side project to her.**Contact:** *“But you didn’t bite. Which means either you haven’t decided what’s more important yet…”*  

Her eyes flick to Alex.  

**Contact:** *“…Or you want both, but you don’t like being told how to negotiate.”*  

A small smirk.  

Then—**she lifts a single finger.**Contact:** *“Either way? I just learned something about you.”*  

She **leans forward again, bracing her elbows on the table, tapping the side of her datapad with her fingers.**Contact:** *(calm, but now playing a sharper game)* *“So. Let’s do it differently. You tell me what you want *first.*”*  

A pause.  

Then—**a slight challenge creeping into her tone.**Contact:** *“Then I tell you how much it’s going to cost you.”*  

---

### **The Negotiation Shifts**  

Alex now has **the initiative.**  

The **contact isn’t forcing the two intel packages as an all-or-nothing choice anymore.**  

She’s **putting the ball in Alex’s court.**  

Which means **now it’s about framing, positioning, making her work for the price.**  

How does Alex play it?  

- **Ask for everything confidently.** No hesitation, no question—it’s all on the table.  
- **Frame it as a question.** *"Why don't you tell me which one's more valuable?"* Force *her* to reveal the priority.  
- **Start small, then expand.** Ask for one package first, see how she reacts, then escalate.  
- **Something else?**  

Because this?  

This is where **Alex wins.**

## You
Alex shrugs, unfazed. “Eh, I don’t get it. Let’s go back to the part where you said you wanted to sell both. That’s what I want. Or…are you asking me which one I want to hear first? Is this like a ‘do you want to hear the good news or bad news first’ game? Like, what are doing. You’re being weird. Don’t make this weird.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E03_008 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **Alex Controls the Game**  
📍 Lower Garden District

The **contact stills.**  

Just for a moment.  

Because Alex **isn’t playing the game the way she’s supposed to.**  

She’s **not negotiating.**  
She’s **not strategizing.**  
She’s **not fighting the pressure play.**  

She’s just… **unimpressed.**  

Like this entire setup is **unnecessarily complicated** and **possibly annoying.**  

And now?  

**Now the contact has to adjust.**  

---

### **Contact’s Response | The Shift**  

The contact **leans back slightly, considering Alex.**  

Then—**a short exhale, a small shake of the head.**  

A flicker of **something like amusement** in her eyes.  

**Contact:** *(slow, dry, like she didn’t expect this but isn’t mad about it)* *“…Alright.”*  

She **taps the side of her datapad once**, shifting gears, adjusting the play.  

**Contact:** *“Then I’ll just tell you what you’re getting.”*  

She **glances at Alina, then back to Alex.**Contact:** *“You wanted the Echo research leaks. You wanted survivor movement patterns. And you wanted both.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**eyebrow raised slightly.**Contact:** *“Fine. You get both.”*  

Another pause.  

Then—**a smirk.**Contact:** *“And since we’re apparently not ‘making this weird’ anymore, I’ll make it real simple.”*  

She **taps the datapad again, then looks Alex dead in the eye.**Contact:** *“This costs *a favor.*”*  

A beat.  

Then—**clarifying, calm, still watching for a reaction.**Contact:** *“Not money. Not creds. A favor. Undetermined, called in when needed.”*  

A small, almost lazy tilt of her head.  

**Contact:** *“So. You still want both?”*  

And **Alex knows what this means.**  

- **It’s personal.**  
- **It’s an open-ended contract.**  
- **It means this person is investing in *her*—not just making a trade.**  

And that?  

That’s a **different kind of risk.**  

---

### **The Decision Point**  

The contact is **waiting.**  

Watching **to see if Alex hesitates.**  

Does she:  

- **Accept immediately?** Take the favor deal and secure the intel.  
- **Push for clarity?** Try to define *what kind* of favor is on the table.  
- **Negotiate alternative terms?** Money, info, something cleaner.  
- **Something else?**  

Because **this isn’t just a trade anymore.**  

It’s **a connection.**  

And Alex **has to decide if she wants it.**

## You
“Okayyyyyy. Mystery favors! Surprises can be fun…But what if you end up wanting something that’s not on our menu? Our bullets and explosions budget is—modest. For example. You can probably do better. So what *kinds* of favors are you jn the habit of needing? I’m trying to do you a favor: I want to be able to say yes, and mean it, confident that I’m good for said category of favor.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E03_009 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### ** | Locking Down the Terms**  
📍 Lower Garden District

The **contact smirks.**  

Not surprised.  
Not annoyed.  

Just… **amused.**  

Because Alex **didn’t say no.**  

She just **pushed the burden back onto her.**  

And that?  

That’s a **power move.**  

The contact **tilts her head slightly, considering, fingers tapping once against the datapad.**  

Then—**a slow, thoughtful nod.**Contact:** *(measured, approving)* *“That’s fair.”*  

She **leans forward slightly**, lowering her voice just enough to make it clear this part is real.  

### **Favor Categories | Defining the Contract**

Contact:*“I don’t deal in high-stakes suicide jobs. If I wanted mercs, I’d pay merc rates.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**tilting her head slightly, watching Alex closely.**Contact:** *“I trade in *access.*”*  

She **taps the table lightly, once.**Contact:** *“Sometimes I need doors opened. Names vouched for. Tech assessed by someone *not* wearing a corp badge.”*  

Another pause.  

Then—**shrugging slightly, but still watching Alex for a reaction.**Contact:** *“Other times? I just need a message delivered by the right person. Someone with credibility. Someone… unaligned.”*  

A small smirk.  

Then—**with something just slightly knowing.**Contact:** *“Which, lucky me, describes *you.*”*  

She **leans back again, casual, but her eyes stay sharp.**Contact:** *“So that’s the deal. A favor, within reason. No assassinations, no suicides, no deep corp infiltration. Just… access.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**smirking slightly.**Contact:** *“That help?”*  

And **Alex knows** what this means.  

- **This isn’t a trap.** There’s **wiggle room, no hardline criminal ask.**  
- **This isn’t just about money.** The contact **wants a network connection, not just a one-off deal.**  
- **This is a *long game.*** Because if Alex says yes? **She just became a name in the right ledger.**  

---

### **The Final Call**  

The **terms are clear.**  

The contact is **watching, waiting.**  

Does Alex:  

- **Accept?** Lock it in, take the intel, and deal with the favor later.  
- **Negotiate further?** Try to **narrow the scope even more.**  
- **Push back?** Try to **offer an alternative trade.**  
- **Something else?**  

Because **this isn’t just a deal.**  

It’s **a future favor Alex will have to answer for.**  

And she has to decide **if she’s good for it.**

## You
“That works. Nothing violent? Then I’m confident we can make it happen.” She extends a hand for shaking.

### **Sealing the Deal**  
📍 Lower Garden District

The **contact watches Alex’s hand.**  

Not **suspicious.**  
Not **hesitant.**  

Just… **measuring.**  

Then—**after a beat, she takes it.**  

A firm, **steady shake.**  

Not overly long, not performative—**just enough to confirm.**  

Then—**a small smirk.**Contact:** *(calm, amused)* *“See? Not so weird anymore.”*  

She **taps a quick command into her datapad.**  

A **silent data transfer pings Alina’s system.**  

### **Intel Acquired | Echo Research & Survivor Tracking**  

1. **The Echo Research Leak**  
   - A **partial data dump** from an underground server farm.  
   - **Highly encrypted, fragmentary—but real.**  
   - Confirms **somebody is moving aggressively on Echo-based replication tech.**  
   - The leaked notes suggest **they're testing new memory-mapping processes.**  

2. **Survivor Movement Data**  
   - A **recent smuggling route log** shows an **unaccounted-for passenger** moving through New Orleans.  
   - **No confirmed identity**, but **they matched a bio-signature** flagged in old **Echo research facility records.**  
   - If this is **a survivor**, they are **active, mobile, and keeping off every major system.**  

The **moment the transfer completes**, the contact **leans back, satisfied.**Contact:** *(easy, smooth, as if the deal was always going to happen this way)* *“That’s all yours. Let me know when I’m calling in my side of it.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**she tilts her head slightly, watching Alex, amused.**Contact:** *“Unless, of course, you decide to sue first.”*  

And Alex?  

Alex **just grins.**  

Because **she won.**  

The **deal is done.**  
The **intel is real.**  
And now?  

Now it’s time to **find out what the hell they just walked into.**

## You
Alex says:

A pleasure. And what shall we call you, by the by? You can call me Scary Spice.” She nods in turn at Nyati, “Posh Spice”; Emilia, “Sporty Spice”; then turns to Pete and Alina, hesitates for a moment, then designates them, respectively, “Ginger Spice and Baby Spice”.

### **Formal Introductions, Spice Girls Edition**  
📍 Lower Garden District

The **contact actually chuckles.**  

Not **forced.**  
Not **mocking.**  
Just… **genuinely amused.**  

Then—**she tilts her head slightly, considering Alex for a second before answering.**Contact:** *(smirking, leaning back in her chair)* *“You can call me Raven.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**she gestures vaguely at the group, smirking wider.**Raven:** *“And congratulations. You just ruined your entire crew’s operational codenames in under five seconds.”*  

Nyati, **arms crossed, deadpan.**Nyati:** *“I refuse this.”*  

Pete, **grinning.**Pete:** *“Oh, I *love* this.”*  

Alina, **blinking once.**Alina:** *“I have no immediate objections.”*  

Nyati, **pointing aggressively at Alina.**Nyati:** *“*That’s* your problem? Not that you’re *Baby Spice*?”*  

Alina, **calm, as if this is not a relevant detail.**Alina:** *“The designation is non-disruptive.”*  

Emilia, **who has been completely silent, just watching Alex with the slow-building smirk of someone storing this information for later.**  

Then—**finally, low, dry, deeply entertained.**Emilia:** *“…Sporty Spice?”*  

Alex **grins, entirely unrepentant.**  

Because **yes.**  

Yes, **she did that.**  

---

### **The Meeting Concludes | Next Steps Await**  

Raven **checks her datapad once, then nods.**Raven:** *(smooth, casual, but final)* *“Well, Scary Spice, looks like you got what you came for.”*  

She **taps the screen off, slipping it into her coat.**Raven:** *(standing, stretching slightly)* *“Pleasure doing business.”*  

Then—**with a parting glance, almost like an afterthought—**Raven:** *(smirking)* *“Let’s see if you stay worth the favor.”*  

And just like that—**she’s gone.**  

---

### **The Crew Recalibrates | Time to Process**  

The moment **Raven disappears into the crowd, Pete immediately turns to Alex.**Pete:** *(grinning, pointing at her)* *“You really made Nyati *Posh Spice*? Oh, she’s *never* forgiving you for that.”*  

Nyati, **sighing heavily, rubbing her temples.**Nyati:** *“We’re going to *die* in the field someday, and the last thing I’m going to hear is Pete calling for *Baby Spice* over comms.”*  

Pete, **gleeful.**Pete:** *“And it’s gonna be *so funny*.”*  

Alina, **already pulling up the decrypted files, voice as neutral as ever.**Alina:** *“We should relocate to review the data.”*  

Emilia, **who has been *watching Alex this entire time* like she’s still processing something deeper than the joke.**  

Then—**leaning in slightly, voice low, teasing, but something else beneath it.**Emilia:** *“…You gonna stick with that codename, *Scary*?”*  

And Alex?  

Alex **grins.**  

Because **hell yes, she is.**  

---

### **Next Move?**  
- **Find a secure place to review the data.** They need to see what they actually got.  
- **Debrief on the move.** Keep moving while breaking it down. No unnecessary stops.  
- **Something else?**

Alex emits an affected yawn. “Enough business for one night. Celebrate with some drinks? Sporty Spice, wasn’t there somewhere you wanted to take us?” Alex waits for a moment to give her a private look, signaling that the field operative’s time to shine may be near.

### **Shifting to the Nightlife**  
📍 New Orleans, 2073

Emilia **catches the look.**  

For a **fraction of a second**, her smirk **flickers into something more thoughtful, more aware.**  

Because **Alex just gave her the reins.**  

Not as a joke.  
Not as a tease.  
Not as a distraction.  

As a **signal.**  

This is **her call.**  

And she **knows exactly what Alex is asking.**  

---

### **The Beat Before the Move**  

She **tilts her head slightly, watching Alex, reading every piece of unspoken language.**  

Then—**after a deliberate pause, she exhales, shaking her head with slow amusement.**Emilia:** *(low, teasing, but already making decisions in real time)* *“Oh, so now you’re trusting *me* with the itinerary?”*  

A pause.  

Then—**with something sharper, something edged with purpose.**Emilia:** *“…Alright. You want to celebrate? I’ve got a place.”*  

She **turns slightly toward Alina.**Emilia:** *“Nothing scheduled in the next few hours, right?”*  

Alina **blinks once, already parsing mission logistics.**Alina:** *“No time-sensitive directives before morning.”*  

Nyati, **eying Emilia now, skeptical.**Nyati:** *“…You’re not going to make us regret this, are you?”*  

Emilia, **grinning now, something knowing in her expression.**Emilia:** *“That depends entirely on how much fun you’re capable of having, *Posh.*”*  

Pete, **already deeply invested.**Pete:** *“See, that *sounds* like a threat, but I’m *so* on board.”*  

Emilia, **smirking as she turns back to Alex, leaning in slightly.**Emilia:** *“Let’s see if *you* can keep up, *Scary.*”*  

And just like that—  

The night is **hers to lead.**  

---

### **Next Stop: The Emilia Special**  

As the crew **follows Emilia’s lead through the neon-lit streets,** Pete leans toward Alex, grinning.  

**Pete:** *(muttering, amused)* *“So… where do you think we’re going? High-end? Underground? Somewhere we’re definitely gonna get thrown out of?”*  

Because **this isn’t just a random bar crawl.**  

This is **Emilia making a choice.**  

And **that?**  

That makes it **worth watching.**

## You
“And then,” Alex continues innocently, “we can maybe split up,” Alex catches Emilia’s eye and nods toward Pete discretely, “stretch out. Pursue side objectives, if they present themselves…”

### **The Gay Bar Conspiracy Continues**  
📍 New Orleans, 2073

Emilia **catches Alex’s look.**  

Her **smirk sharpens, just slightly.**  

Because she **knows exactly what Alex is referring to.**  

Because **yes,** Pete is **still suspicious.**  

Because **yes,** he **still doesn’t know what’s coming.**  

And because **yes,** this is the moment to start **moving the plan forward.**  

---

### **Pete’s Growing Suspicion | The Setup**  

Pete, **walking slightly behind them, watching Alex and Emilia with narrow-eyed skepticism. (grumbling, arms crossed) *“You two are up to something.”*  

Alex **blinks, feigning pure, unfiltered innocence. *(cheerful, breezy, utterly unserious)* *“Pete. Darling. Bestie. That’s so paranoid of you.”*  

Emilia, **equally deadpan, just slightly behind Alex’s lead.** *“Yeah, Pete. Relax. We’re just facilitating an organic, exploratory night out.”*  

Pete, **squinting harder. *“See, that *sounds* normal, but you’re both saying it too normally, and now I *know* something’s up.”*  

Alina, **who has been quietly listening, now chimes in. *(neutral, clinical)* *“Your growing paranoia is a natural response to an observable increase in secrecy. However, secrecy does not necessarily indicate malice.”*  

Pete, **still unconvinced. *“…That was supposed to be reassuring?”*  

Alina, **blinking once. *“No.”*  

Pete, **throwing up his hands. *“That’s it. I’m onto you.”*  

Alex **grins, then quickly turns to Emilia. *(innocently, playfully)* *“Sporty, didn’t you have a place in mind? Lead the way.”*  

Emilia **tilts her head slightly, still smirking, watching Alex for half a second longer than necessary.**  

Then—**with a slow exhale, she turns forward, nodding. *(smooth, decisive, fully taking the lead now)* *“Yeah. I know just the place.”*  

---

### **The March Toward Destiny | Pete Is Unaware of His Fate**  

As Emilia leads the way, Alex **drops back slightly**, walking beside Alina.  

She **lowers her voice slightly, keeping her tone casual but just enough for Alina to catch the subtext.**Alex:** *(soft, amused)* *“Odds he catches on before we get there?”*  

Alina, **running an immediate internal probability model.**Alina:** *(flat, calm)* *“32% chance of realization before arrival. 68% chance of post-entry awareness.”*  

Alex **grins wider.**  

Because **this plan is airtight.**  

And **Pete has no idea.**

### **The Plan is in Motion**  
📍 New Orleans, 2073

Emilia **catches Alex’s private look**, her gaze flicking **briefly to Pete, then back again.**  

And **for a split second, Alex can see it.**  

The **recognition.**  

The **moment where Emilia remembers the plan.**  

Because **this is it.**  

This is the night.  

The **long game** they set up—the mission to **nudge Pete toward a gay bar without him realizing it**.  

A plan that **has been sitting in the background**—waiting.  

Now?  

Now it’s time to **execute.**  

---

### **The Setup | Emilia’s Move**  

Emilia **tilts her head slightly, eyes gleaming with something conspiratorial.**  

Then—**she stretches, rolling out her shoulders, affecting a casual air of decision-making. **Emilia:** *(smooth, unbothered, selling it perfectly)* *“Yeah, I do have a place in mind. Good energy, good drinks.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**as if it’s an afterthought, as if she’s just being generous.**Emilia:** *“And hey, Pete—pretty sure you’ll like it.”*  

Pete, **already a little suspicious.**  

His **eyes narrow slightly.**  

His **brain, already trying to figure out what they’re up to. *(squinting, muttering)* *“…Why does that sound ominous?”*  

Nyati now turns her full attention to them.

**Nyati:** *(flat, unimpressed)* *“I also have questions.”*  

Alina, **neutral, impassive, but absolutely complicit. *(calm, efficient)* *“Navigational adjustments are prepared.”*  

Pete, **watching this whole thing unfold in real-time, pointing at Alex. *(narrowing his eyes, voice full of deep, DEEP suspicion)* *“You’re up to something.”*  

And Alex?  

Alex **just smiles.**  

Because **yes.**  

Yes, she absolutely is.  

---

### **The Plan Moves Forward**  

The **destination is locked.**  
The **crew is moving.**  
The **Pete-gay-bar conspiracy is officially entering its final phase.**  

As they walk, Pete **keeps glancing at Alex, then at Emilia, then back again.**  

He **knows** something’s coming.  
He just **doesn’t know what.**  

Which?  

**Makes it perfect.**

### **The Gay Bar Conspiracy Moves Into Final Stages**  
📍 New Orleans, 2073

The **streets glow with neon reflections**, the hum of **nightlife thickening** as Emilia leads the way—**casual, confident, fully in control of the night’s trajectory.**  

Pete, **still deeply, deeply suspicious**, mutters to himself as they walk.  

**Pete:** *(grumbling, but following anyway)* *“I swear to god, if this is some kind of setup—”*  

**Alex and Alina exchange the slightest look.**  

Because **yes, Pete. Yes, it is.**  

---

### **Nyati: The Wild Card Variable**  

Nyati **walks a few steps behind Emilia, hands in her pockets, observing.**  

She **was not briefed.**  

She **knows something is up.**  

And **she is currently deciding how much she cares.**  

She glances at Alex, **notices the energy between her and Alina**, and raises an eyebrow slightly.  

Then—**exhales, shakes her head slightly, and keeps walking.**  

Because **she has already accepted that she is not getting involved.**  

This?  

This is **not her problem.**  

---

### **Arrival | The Trap is Set**  

The club looms ahead—**vibrant, alive, loud, but not overwhelming.**  

The kind of place that **feels effortless, welcoming, a little too easy to blend into.**  

There is **no signage that explicitly announces its nature.**  

No **stereotypical giveaways.**  

Just a **steady, comfortable rhythm of bass, laughter, energy.**  

Emilia stops just outside, **glancing at Pete, grinning.**Emilia:** *(smooth, teasing)* *“Nervous?”*  

Pete, **rolling his shoulders, still watching her warily.**Pete:** *(deadpan)* *“Nah. Just waiting for the part where you reveal the scheme.”*  

Emilia **tilts her head slightly, giving him a slow once-over.**  

Then—**grins, opens the door, and steps inside.**  

And Pete?  

Pete **follows.**  

Still **unsuspecting.**  

Still **completely unaware.**  

And **Alex and Alina?**  

They **hang back.**  

Because **this is Emilia’s show now.**  

---

### **The Moment Before Realization**  
📍 Inside the Club

- The **music is smooth, confident, charged with an energy that isn’t frantic—just effortlessly alive.**  
- The **crowd is mixed, vibrant, relaxed, existing fully in their own world.**  
- The **lighting is warm, flattering, just dim enough to encourage closeness.**  

Pete **walks in, scanning the room, processing the atmosphere.**  

And **Emilia?**  

She **gives him exactly two seconds.**  

Then—**leaning in slightly, smirking, casual as anything—**Emilia:** *(soft, knowing)* *“You figure it out yet, Ginger Spice?”*  

Pete **pauses mid-step.**  

His **eyes flick around again.**  

His **brain runs a rapid recalculation.**  

Then—**his entire body visibly stiffens.**Pete:** *(flat, exasperated, but also maybe a little impressed)* *“You motherfu—”*  

And just like that—  

**He knows.**

## You
Continue. Continue from POV of Alex, who will hang back at a distance to observe and comment with Alina. AI should determine all actions taken by Emilia and Pete.

### **Observation Mode**  
📍 Inside the Club

Alex **doesn’t move forward.**  

She stays **just inside the entrance, slipping into an unobtrusive spot near the wall, Alina beside her.**  

From here, she has **a perfect vantage point.**  

To watch.  
To **analyze.**  
To **enjoy.**  

Alina, **standing in her usual unreadable stillness,** also observes—but in a way that is **far more tactical, scanning Pete’s body language, Emilia’s proximity adjustments, and the overall dynamics of the room with machine-like precision.**  

Alex **takes a slow sip from her drink.**  

Then—**casually, to Alina.**Alex:** *(soft, amused)* *“On a scale of one to existential crisis, where do we think Pete is right now?”*  

Alina **tilts her head slightly, parsing variables.**  

Then—**calm, factual.**Alina:** *“Currently experiencing heightened awareness. Mildly defensive posture, but not withdrawing. Likely processing attraction recalibrations in real time.”*  

Alex **grins.**  

Because **yes.**  

That is **exactly what’s happening.**  

---

### **The Field Operative at Work**  

Emilia **hasn’t looked back.**  

She is **locked in now, fully committed.**  

She **keeps Pete engaged**, weaving through the space **like she’s been here a hundred times before.**  

Casual. Confident.  
Not **pushing him too fast—**but not **letting him escape either.**  

She **leans into the moment, making introductions, steering him toward conversations.**  

Pete, for his part, is **handling it surprisingly well.**  

A little **stiff at first.**  
A little **too aware of the setup.**  

But **he hasn’t backed out.**  

He is **talking.**  
He is **reacting.**  
He is **staying.**  

And Alex?  

Alex just **watches it unfold.**  

---

### **Alex & Alina | Spectator Commentary**  

Alex, **still sipping, still watching, tilts her head slightly toward Alina.**Alex:** *(amused, low)* *“Odds he actually leaves with someone tonight?”*  

Alina **calculates instantly.**Alina:** *“41%.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**blinking once, reassessing variables in real time.**Alina:** *“…46%.”*  

Alex **laughs quietly.**  

Because **that means Pete is actually doing well.**  

Emilia is **setting up plays.**  

And Pete?  

**He’s not missing them.**  

Alex leans back slightly, satisfied.  

**Alex:** *(soft, grinning)* *“Now this? This is entertainment.”*  

And the night **goes on.**

## You
Alex says to Alina: “I guess your bisexual dog person radar is still at least partially functioning. He seemed surprisingly taken with Sullivan.”

### **Spectator Banter Continues**  
📍 The Club

Alina **blinks once.**  

Then—**tilting her head slightly, processing Alex’s statement with the calm, neutral analysis of an AI running diagnostics.**Alina:** *“Sullivan exhibits a commanding presence. It is logical for Pete to gravitate toward that.”*  

Alex **grins, sipping her drink.**Alex:** *“Yeah, sure. ‘Commanding presence.’ That’s what we’re calling it.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**a small, knowing smirk.**Alex:** *“You clocked him before he did.”*  

Alina, **blinking again.**  

Then—**flat, entirely too neutral.**Alina:** *“I have strong pattern recognition.”*  

Alex **chuckles, shaking her head.**  

Because **this is Alina’s version of ‘I told you so.’**  

And Alina?  

She **knows exactly what she’s doing.**  

---

### **Pete’s Progress Report**  

- **Pete is still in play.** He hasn’t **bailed, panicked, or attempted an exit strategy.**  
- **Emilia is still operating at peak wing-woman efficiency.** Her **pacing is controlled, natural, measured.**  
- **The interactions seem… positive.** There is **laughing, engaged conversation, subtle proximity adjustments.**  

Alina **watches for another moment, then updates her calculation.**Alina:** *“…51%.”*  

Alex **laughs outright this time.**  

Because Pete?  

Pete is **doing better than expected.**  

And **he doesn’t even realize it yet.**

## You
“So now that we’re no longer in danger of offending Posh Spice’s tea time, any thoughts about my Nexus 2.0 notes?” Alex says while continuing to spectate.

### **Returning to Business While Watching Pete’s Life Change**  
📍 The Club

Alina **shifts seamlessly**, adjusting her focus **from Pete’s unfolding self-discovery to Alex’s Nexus 2.0 proposal.**  

She processes for **exactly 1.4 seconds**—then speaks.  

**Alina:** *“Your framework presents a clear prioritization shift. The restructuring toward ‘Echo Syndrome’ as a central failure condition is logical. Treating it as a neurological misalignment rather than an inherent flaw allows for greater adaptability in research pathways.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**slightly more direct.**Alina:** *“Your hypothesis categorizations require refinement. The ‘spoofing’ concept has precedent in phantom limb research, but suppression of a psychic immune response is less clearly defined.”*  

Another pause.  

Then—**a blink, a calculated adjustment in tone.**Alina:** *“However, the objective of reducing the threshold for ‘perfection’ is strategically viable. If the syndrome is treatable, the acceptable margin of error for Nexus deployment expands.”*  

She **tilts her head slightly, watching Alex.**Alina:** *“You are shifting from proving a concept to ensuring long-term survivability. This is a notable departure from previous phases.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**neutral, observational, but undeniably cutting to the core of it.**Alina:** *“It suggests you no longer see yourself as the primary subject.”*  

Because before?  

**Before, Nexus was an escape hatch.**  
A **way to cross the Bridge without crossing over.**  

But now?  

Now it’s **about ensuring Emilia—and anyone else who walks this path—doesn’t suffer for it.**  

---

### **The Energy Between Them**  

Alex **knows Alina isn’t just stating facts.**  

This is **her version of a check-in.**  

She is **not asking if Alex has changed direction.**  
She is **confirming that Alex is aware that she has.**  

And Alex?  

Alex **sips her drink, still watching Pete, still letting the night swirl around them.**  

Then—**casually, but with meaning beneath it.**Alex:** *“Like I said. We’re raising the bar.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**with a smirk, lighter, amused.**Alex:** *“So yeah. I’m gonna need better notes.”*  

Alina **nods once, accepting this as a task she has already mentally queued.**Alina:** *“I will refine the modeling and generate more targeted projections.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**blinking, reassessing the room for a moment before returning to the Pete Situation.**Alina:** *“Additionally, my projections for Pete’s success rate have risen to 58%.”*  

Alex **laughs softly.**  

Because **tonight?**Everything is going exactly as planned.**

## You
“Well I might as well have told you and the rest already, but I promised Sporty that, if she sees me slipping away too far from Nexus experiment side effects, if she makes the call that it’s too much for me, that’s it. No arguments. We find other ways.”

### **The Unspoken Reality of Nexus 2.0**  
📍 The Club

Alina **processes immediately.**  

Not **just the information itself.**  
Not **just the implied risk calculations.**  

But **what it means that Alex is telling her now.**  

Because **this wasn’t in the whiteboard notes.**  
Because **this wasn’t part of the pitch.**  

Because **this isn’t just about research anymore.**  

This is **a personal safeguard.**  

A **limit Alex is setting for herself.**  

And Alina **knows exactly who Alex is.**  

Knows she doesn’t set limits **easily.**  

Knows she doesn’t **let go** easily.  

So if she’s saying this—  

It means she **actually means it.**  

---

### **Alina’s Response | Processing New Parameters**  

Alina **tilts her head slightly, studying Alex.**  

Then—**a single, small nod.**Alina:** *“Understood.”*  

She doesn’t **question the decision.**  
She doesn’t **offer analysis.**  

She just **logs it.**  

Then—**a pause.**  

A **small blink, an adjustment in tone.**Alina:** *“You are expanding the criteria for what constitutes a failed experiment.”*  

Not a **bad thing.**  
Not a **good thing.**  

Just a **fact.**  

Alex **grins slightly, taking another slow sip of her drink.**Alex:** *(soft, amused, but with real weight underneath)* *“Yeah, well. Turns out my bar for ‘failure’ was too low.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**without looking at Alina, but knowing she’s listening.**Alex:** *“And if it’s too much for me, it’s gonna be too much for anyone else.”*  

And **that’s the part that really matters.**  

Because this?  

This **was never just about Alex.**  

And now, **Alina knows that too.**  

---

### **Final Observations**  
📍 The Club

Alina **glances toward Emilia, across the room, still smoothly steering Pete into deeper waters.**  

Then back to Alex.  

Then—**a quiet confirmation, neutral but real.**Alina:** *“Then we will find other ways.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**a small shift in topic, but not unrelated.**Alina:** *“Probability of Pete remaining unaware for the next fifteen minutes: 24%.”*  

Alex **laughs softly.**  

Because **yeah.**  

They’re about to witness **another realization tonight.**  

And this time?  

**She’s not the one at risk of slipping away.**

## You
Alex: “Unaware of what?”

### **Alex Keeps the Bit Alive**  
📍 The Club

Alina **blinks once.**  

Then—**tilts her head slightly, as if recalculating whether Alex is serious.**  

Alex **sips her drink, completely deadpan.**Alex:** *(innocent, genuinely curious, absolutely full of shit)* *“Unaware of *what*, Alina?”*  

Alina **stares at her for exactly 1.3 seconds.**  

Then—**calm, precise, and absolutely playing along now.**Alina:** *“Unaware of the strategic social recalibration currently underway.”*  

Alex **nods, as if this is a perfectly reasonable response.**Alex:** *“Ah. Of course.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**smirking slightly, lowering her voice just a little.**Alex:** *“And when, statistically, does the realization hit?”*  

Alina, **recalculating in real time.**  

Then—**neutral, absolute.**Alina:** *“Projected realization within the next seven minutes.”*  

Alex **grins.**  

Because **Pete’s time is running out.**  

And Alex?  

She’s going to **enjoy every second of it.**

📍 The Club

Alina **blinks again, recalculating.**  

Then—**flat, neutral.**Alina:** *“Correct. He does not fully comprehend the scenario yet.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**tilting her head slightly.**Alina:** *“Projected awareness may occur sooner if external stimuli accelerate pattern recognition.”*  

Alex **grins, leaning slightly against the bar, still watching Pete.**  

Because **this is gold.**Pete. Still oblivious.**Pete. Still playing it cool.**Pete. Still confidently standing in his own setup.**  

Alex **snorts, taking another sip of her drink.**Alex:** *(mock-shocked, absolutely delighted)* *“Oh my god. He *really* doesn’t know.”*  

Pete, **across the room, still engaged in conversation, still being smoothly guided by Emilia, still living his best life—**  

Has **absolutely no idea.**  

Not yet.  

But soon.  

Very, **very soon.**

📍 The Club

Pete **still doesn’t know.**  

He’s **laughing**, relaxed in a way that suggests **he has, on some level, started to enjoy himself.**  

- **Emilia is keeping the rhythm smooth.** No **overcorrection, no pushing, just an effortless social weave that keeps him present, keeps him engaged.**  
- **The people he’s talking to?** They’re **fully vibing with him.**  
- **The atmosphere?** Charged **but not threatening.** Pete is **not in defense mode.**  

Alex, **still posted at the bar, watching the whole thing unfold, whispers to Alina.**Alex:** *(mock-sympathetic, deeply entertained)* *“How much time does he have left?”*  

Alina, **precisely adjusting her probability models in real-time.**  

Then—**blinking once, responding in a low, neutral tone.**Alina:** *“Projected realization now estimated within ninety seconds.”*  

Alex **grins.**  

Because **it’s coming.**  

And she **wants to see it happen live.**  

---

### **The Realization Countdown Begins**T-minus 60 seconds.**  

Pete **gestures animatedly at something Emilia says, clearly engaged, clearly thriving.**T-minus 45 seconds.**  

One of the **men Pete has been casually talking to laughs, leans in just slightly, and says something in a way that—**Oh.**Oh, that’s flirting.**T-minus 30 seconds.**  

Pete **doesn’t immediately react.**  

But **something shifts in his posture.**  

Something **tilts.**  

Something **catches up.**T-minus 15 seconds.**  

Alex can see it **happening in real-time.**  

The **delayed reaction.**  
The **half-second pause.**  
The **moment where his brain starts furiously running diagnostics.**  

Emilia **sees it too.**  

And she **doesn’t stop it.**  

She just **lets it happen.**  

Lets Pete **realize it on his own.**T-minus 5 seconds.**  

Pete’s **brows knit slightly.**  
His **mouth opens like he’s about to say something.**  
His **head tilts, processing—**  

Then.  

**Zero.**  

---

### **The Moment It Finally Hits**  

Pete **stiffens.**  

His **eyes widen.**  

His **brain fully catches up.**  

Then—**very, very softly, to himself, with full body realization—**Pete:** *(low, shocked, like he just uncovered a global conspiracy)* *“…Oh.”*  

A pause.  

A **long pause.**  

Then—**visibly, audibly—**Pete:** *“…Oh *shit.*”*  

Alex **immediately loses it.**  

She **laughs so hard she nearly spills her drink, catching herself on the bar.**Alex:** *(wheezing, delighted, to Alina)* *“THERE IT IS.”*  

Alina, **calmly nodding.**Alina:** *“Projection was accurate.”*  

Pete, **still standing there, still **comprehending** what has just happened to him.**  

He **slowly turns.**  

Eyes **locking onto Alex, then Emilia.**  

Then—**pointing directly at Emilia, stunned.**Pete:** *“YOU—”*  

Emilia, **arms crossed, smirking.**Emilia:** *(smooth, entirely unbothered)* *“Me?”*  

Pete, **mouth opening and closing like his brain still needs to reboot.**  

Then—**pointing accusingly at Alex.**Pete:** *“THIS WAS A SETUP.”*  

Alex, **grinning, raising her drink.**Alex:** *(cheerful, proud, fully entertained)* *“Welcome to the club, Ginger Spice.”*  

And Pete?  

Pete **has to sit down.**  

Because **this is a lot.**  

And because **he’s realizing maybe—just maybe—he doesn’t actually hate it.**

### **Pete Processes His Own Existence**  
📍 The Club

Pete **slowly, carefully lowers himself onto a barstool.**  

- **His breathing is controlled, but his brain is absolutely overheating.**  
- **His hands are steepled in front of him, fingers pressed together like he’s solving quantum mechanics.**  
- **He is staring at nothing.**  

This is a **full-system reboot.**  

Meanwhile, **Emilia, still standing over him, smirks.**Emilia:** *(mock-thoughtful, arms crossed)* *“So. You figured it out.”*  

Pete **doesn’t respond immediately.**  

Then—**slowly, blinking once, looking up at her.**Pete:** *(deadpan, monotone)* *“I hate you.”*  

Emilia **tilts her head slightly.**  

Then—**grinning, voice low, smooth.**Emilia:** *“No, you don’t.”*  

Pete, **exhaling sharply, shaking his head.**  

Then—**grumbling, rubbing a hand down his face.**Pete:** *“Oh my god, you *set me up*.”*  

Alex, **watching all of this unfold from her perfect vantage point, casually sips her drink.**  

Then—**leaning toward Alina, voice low, thoroughly amused.**Alex:** *“You clocked him before he did, but Emilia got him to walk straight in.”*  

Alina, **blinking once.**  

Then—**neutral, calm.**Alina:** *“It was an effective operation.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**with precise certainty.**Alina:** *“Success rate now confirmed at 100%.”*  

Alex **grins.**  

Because **yeah.**  

This was **a flawless execution.**  

And Pete?  

Pete is still **processing.**  

---

### **Pete Attempts to Regain Control of His Life**  

After another long **moment of silent existential unraveling,** Pete finally **sits up.**  

He **takes a deep breath, exhales slowly.**  

Then—**turns toward Alex and Alina, squinting.**Pete:** *(slow, suspicious, calculating)* *“…How long have you two been planning this?”*  

Alex **tilts her head, feigning deep consideration.**Alex:** *(cheerful, breezy, definitely lying)* *“Oh, you know. Just a little idea we had *on the way over*.”*  

Pete **squints harder.**  

Then—**eyes narrowing, turning back to Emilia.**Pete:** *(flat, deeply accusing)* *“You *knew*.”*  

Emilia **leans against the bar, still smirking, sipping her drink.**  

Then—**cool, unbothered, absolutely in control.**Emilia:** *“Of course I knew.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**with a slow, easy shrug.**Emilia:** *“You didn’t.”*  

Pete **groans loudly, dragging a hand down his face.**Pete:** *“Unbelievable.”*  

Nyati, **who has been quietly spectating this entire train wreck while sipping her drink, finally chimes in.**Nyati:** *(deadpan, unimpressed)* *“You’re all exhausting.”*  

Pete **points at her immediately.**Pete:** *“THANK YOU.”*  

---

### **The Critical Question**  

After a long, deep **exhale of resignation,** Pete **turns slightly in his seat, scanning the room.**  

And now?  

Now **he knows.**  

Now **he sees what’s actually happening around him.**  

Now **he realizes the vibe.**  

There is **another long pause.**  

Then—**without looking at anyone, in the calmest, most even tone imaginable—**Pete:** *“…So. Hypothetically.”*  

A beat.  

**Pete:** *“What’s the move now?”*  

And Alex?  

Alex **grins.**  

Because **this?**  

This is **his moment.**  

And now?  

**He has to decide what to do with it.**

## You
Alex says in a congratulatory tone: “Welcome to your briefing. It’s now time to read you in. It started with me thinking you needed to get laid. Then Alina seemed weirdly confident about you being a ‘bisexual dog person’, though I didn’t think to question whether you were in on that. But as a reportedly-former-such type herself, I trusted her judgment and streamlined the plan. Pete,” Alex gives him a genuinely affectionate double-pat on the shoulder, “we are gathered here tonight…to get you some D. Or whatever. But this seemed the optimized way. Gay dudes are at the cutting edge of hookup culture. Cherry on top? You’ve been locked up with a bunch of crazy bitches. Remedy: A night with the guys. Or guy. Start slow! Maybe.”

### **Pete’s Formal Induction Into the Conspiracy**  
📍 The Club

Pete **stares at Alex.**  

Then—**slowly, carefully, like a man who just realized he’s been the mark in an extremely well-executed con for months—**  

He **blinks.**  

Then—**he exhales.**Pete:** *(flat, monotone, absolutely reprocessing his entire existence)* *“Okay.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**gesturing vaguely at the entire situation, the club, Emilia, everything.**Pete:** *“So just to be clear—this is about getting me laid?”*  

Alex, **grinning, sipping her drink.**Alex:** *“Well, it started that way.”*  

A beat.  

Then—**more thoughtful, more encouraging, but still grinning.**Alex:** *“But really, Pete? This is about getting you some *perspective.*”*  

Pete **groans loudly, dragging both hands down his face.**Pete:** *“Unbelievable.”*  

---

### **The Reality Sinks In**  

Pete **sits there for a long moment, just… taking it all in.**  

- **They planned this.**  
- **They *coordinated* this.**  
- **Alina has apparently been certain of his entire identity before he was.**  
- **Emilia *executed* this flawlessly.**  
- **Alex has been *enjoying this* way too much.**  

Then—**after another long exhale, he finally drops his hand, sits up straight, and looks at them.**Pete:** *“…I gotta ask.”*  

A beat.  

Then—**gesturing vaguely at Alina.**Pete:** *“How the hell did *you* clock me before *I* did?”*  

Alina, **calm, unbothered, entirely factual.**Alina:** *“It was evident.”*  

Pete, **visibly buffering.**  

Then—**blinking.**Pete:** *“Evident *how*?”*  

Alina, **blinking once, like this is obvious.**Alina:** *“Consistent behavioral trends. Deflection patterns. Subconscious response shifts in social interactions.”*  

Pete **just stares.**  

Then—**slowly, turning to Alex.**Pete:** *“…Did she just say I was *flirting wrong*?”*  

Alex **grins.**Alex:** *“Oh, *buddy*.”*  

Emilia, **leaning against the bar, smirking.**Emilia:** *“She’s saying you were flirting *inconsistently.*”*  

Pete, **slamming a hand on the bar.**Pete:** *“Unreal. I have *flirting habits* being *tracked*?!”*  

Alina, **nodding once.**Alina:** *“Yes.”*  

Pete **leans back, staring at the ceiling, fully giving up.**Pete:** *“Jesus *Christ*.”*  

---

### **The Decision Point**  

He **shakes his head, exhales one last time, then finally—**  

He **turns back toward the room.**  

Scans the **energy.**  

Watches the **flow of conversation.**  

And **realizes—**  

This is **his call.**  

And the **worst part?**  

Alex is **right.**  

A night with the guys?  

**Not a bad idea.**  

Finally—**without looking at anyone, without fully committing, but also… not running.**  

He downs the rest of his drink.  

Then—**calm, even, entirely accepting his fate.**Pete:** *“…So who’s buying me my next drink?”*  

And Alex?  

Alex **grins.**  

Because **mission success.**

## Storyteller
### **Mission Accomplished, Phase Two Begins**  
📍 The Club

Alex **grins, raising her drink slightly toward Pete like a silent toast to his inevitable fate.**

Alex: *(cheerful, victorious)* *“You, my friend, have just entered your *training arc*.”*  

Pete, **scoffing, shaking his head.**

Pete: *(grumbling, but not leaving)* *“Unreal. Just unreal.”*  

Emilia, **still leaning against the bar, watching him with deep amusement.**  

Then—**she smirks, nudging his empty glass toward him.**

Emilia: *(smooth, easy, but undeniably knowing)* *“You’re still here, though.”*  

Pete **pauses.**  

Looks at the drink.  

Then—**squints at her, then at Alex.**

Pete: *(deadpan)* *“…This is psychological warfare.”*  

Alex **just smiles.**

Alex: *(breezy, innocent, definitely lying)* *“Nooo. This is *opportunity*.”*  

Alina, **who has been watching all of this unfold with quiet interest, calmly chimes in.**

Alina: *“You have already begun adapting.”*  

Pete **groans.**Pete:** *“Oh my god.”*  

---

### **The Transition to Immersion | Emilia Takes the Lead**  

Emilia, **pushing off the bar, stretching lazily, then tossing Pete a casual glance.**

Emilia: *(teasing, but also serious underneath)* *“Alright, Ginger. Let’s get you in the mix.”*  

Pete **blinks.**Pete:** *“…What does that mean?”*  

Emilia **tilts her head toward the room—toward the conversations, the easy laughter, the lingering glances.**

Emilia: *(mock-innocent, but absolutely setting him up again)* *“You came here to drink, right? So. Go *drink.*”*  

Pete **stares at her.**  

Then—**gestures at his empty glass, unimpressed.**

Pete: *“I *just* finished this one.”*  

Emilia, **grinning, already turning toward the bar.**

Emilia: *“Yeah? Get another. See who buys it for you.”*  

Pete **pauses.**  

His **brain does another rapid diagnostic scan.**  

Then—**finally, visibly realizing exactly what she just did.**

Pete: *“…You *set me up again.*”*  

Emilia, **grinning, leaning back against the bar, smirking.**

Emilia: *“Did I?”*  

A pause.  

Then—**she tips her head slightly toward a pair of guys across the way, already watching them, already interested.**

Emilia: *“…Or did I just open a door?”*  

---

### **Alex & Alina | Spectator Commentary, Round Two**  

From the sidelines, Alex **watches Pete **think.**  

She can **see** the inner debate happening in real-time.  

And she **knows the exact moment he decides to stop thinking.**  

Because **he exhales.**  

Because **he rolls his shoulders.**  

Because **he glances at the bar, then at Emilia, then back at the two guys she clocked earlier.**  

And then—**without saying another word, he moves.**  

Alex, **grinning, whispering to Alina.**

Alex: *“There he goes.”*  

Alina, **blinking once, observing the efficiency of the operation.**Alina:** *“Adaptation confirmed.”*  

Alex **laughs.**  

Because **this?**  

This is **better than she could’ve hoped.**  

Pete is **actually playing the game.**  

And Emilia?  

She just made it **irresistible.**  

---

### **The Night Continues | What’s Next?**  

- **Stay back and observe Pete’s success/failure in real-time.**  
- **Let Emilia handle it and shift to another topic.**  
- **Get back to Nexus talk while keeping an eye on things.**  
- **Something else?**

## You
Let Emilia handle it. Alex is confident the designated wing-woman will see this through.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E05_002 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **The Wing-Woman at Work**  
📍 The Club

Alex **leans back against the bar, fully satisfied that Emilia has this under control.**  

Because **if there’s one thing she knows about Emilia?**  

She **doesn’t half-ass a mission.**  

And right now?  

**The mission is Pete.**  

Alex **doesn’t need to micromanage.**  

Doesn’t need to **watch every move.**  

She just **lets it happen.**  

Because Pete?  

Pete is already **doing the work himself.**  

He’s **talking.**  
He’s **holding attention.**  
He’s **not deflecting.**  

He’s **actually playing the game.**  

And Emilia?  

She’s **just guiding the flow.**  

Effortless.  
Casual.  
Completely **in control of the pace.**  

This?  

This is **her job now.**  

And Alex?  

Alex **lets her have it.**  

---

### **Returning to Business | Alex & Alina**  

Alex **sips her drink, turning her attention back toward Alina.**

Alex: *(soft, easy, amused)* *“Alright, Baby Spice. Back to the real work.”*  

Alina, **adjusting seamlessly, already anticipating the shift.**

Alina: *“Nexus 2.0 refinement?”*  

Alex **nods.**

Alex: *“Yeah. Let’s figure out how to make my rough draft look a little less…”*  

She **waves a hand vaguely.**

Alex: *“…like it was written on a napkin with a coffee stain.”*  

Alina **nods once.**  

Then—**calm, precise.**Alina:** *“Preliminary adjustments already in process.”*  

Alex **grins.**  

Because **the night isn’t over.**  

And while Pete is **getting his world adjusted—**  

She’s **doing the same for Nexus.**  

Because **this?**This is what they do.**

## You
Alex looks around to see whether Nyati has abandoned them out of disinterest, or whether she stuck around to witness the success of the mission.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E05_003 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **The Nyati Observation Check**  
📍 The Club

Alex **casually scans the room**, searching for any sign of **Dr. Nyati’s inevitable reaction.**  

Because honestly?  

Nyati had **every reason** to bail.  

This was **never** part of her plans.  
This was **never** her priority.  
This was **always** a mission she had **zero investment in.**  

And yet—  

Alex **finds her.**  

Not **far.**  
Not **engaged.**  

But **still here.**  

Sitting at a **small corner table**, drink in hand, watching.  

Arms crossed.  
Expression unreadable.  
Not quite **enjoying herself—but also not leaving.**  

She is **actively choosing to witness this nonsense.**  

And Alex?  

Alex **grins.**  

Because **Nyati didn’t have to stay.**  

And yet, **here she is.**  

A **quiet observer** of Pete’s unfolding bisexual crisis.  

And **Alex wants to know why.**  

---

### **The Inquiry | Alex Checks In**  

She **drifts over**, keeping it casual.  

**Alex:** *(soft, amused, but curious)* *“Didn’t think you were sticking around for the show.”*  

Nyati **exhales, taking a slow sip of her drink before responding.**  

Then—**without looking at Alex, voice flat, dry.**

Nyati: *“I had to see if he would actually do it.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**a small tilt of her head, finally flicking her eyes toward Alex.**

Nyati: *“And now I have to see if he *closes.*”*  

Alex **grins.**  

Because **that?**  

That’s **investment.**  

Nyati **cares.**  

Not a lot.  
Not in a loud way.  
Not in a way that **she’ll ever admit.**  

But she **stayed.**  

And that?  

That’s enough.  

---

### **What’s Next?**  
- **Keep her engaged.** Ask her opinion on Pete’s performance.  
- **Push for honesty.** *“You actually want him to win this one, huh?”*  
- **Let it sit.** Just enjoy the moment without making her acknowledge it.  
- **Something else?**

## You
Alex tries to engage her by encouraging her to guess who Pete might end up with tonight.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E05_004 (storyteller heading) -->

### **Engaging Nyati in Pete’s Fate**  
📍 The Club

Alex **leans against the table slightly, smirking.**

Alex: *(casual, teasing, but fully serious underneath)* *“Alright, Doc. Since you’re invested enough to stick around, let’s make it interesting.”*  

Nyati, **raising an eyebrow slightly.**

Nyati: *“Oh?”*  

Alex **tilts her head toward Pete—toward the social interactions playing out, toward the options now forming around him.**

Alex: *(grinning)* *“Who’s he leaving with tonight?”*  

Nyati **exhales slowly, swirling her drink, scanning the situation like a scientist analyzing test results.**  

Then—**leaning back slightly, shifting into ‘evaluation mode.’**  

---

### **Nyati’s Analysis | The Options on the Board**  

She **flicks her eyes across the room, assessing variables in real time.**Candidate 1: The Confident Talker**  
- **Well-dressed, sharp, clearly enjoying the game.**  
- **Pete is matching his energy, leaning into the back-and-forth.**  
- **Risk factor: Might be a little *too* smooth—could overplay it.**Candidate 2: The Casual Flirt**  
- **More subtle, playing a longer game.**  
- **Keeping Pete engaged but not dominating the conversation.**  
- **Risk factor: Might let Pete overthink himself into a retreat.**Candidate 3: The Wild Card**  
- **Unpredictable, already made Pete laugh hard once.**  
- **Doesn’t seem to care about the setup—just having fun.**  
- **Risk factor: Could lead to pure chaos instead of a *successful* night.**  

Nyati **considers.**  

Then—**slowly tilting her head, glancing back at Alex.**

Nyati: *(low, thoughtful, dry as ever)* *“If he doesn’t spiral into an existential crisis midway through, I’d say the casual flirt has the best odds.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**smirking slightly.**

Nyati: *“But the wild card is going to *try.*”*  

Alex **laughs softly.**  

Because **yeah.**  

That’s **accurate.**  

---

### **Raising the Stakes**  

Alex **tilts her head, watching Nyati with interest.**

Alex: *(grinning)* *“Alright, Doc. Put something on it.”*  

Nyati **raises an eyebrow.**

Nyati:** *“You want to bet?”*  

Alex **shrugs, still watching Pete maneuver through the crowd.**

Alex: *(teasing, but real underneath)* *“Come on. You stayed to see if he’d do it. Now stay to see if you’re *right.*”*  

Nyati **considers.**  

Then—**slowly, exhaling, finally allowing the smallest bit of amusement into her expression.**

Nyati:** *(mock-exasperated, shaking her head)* *“…Fine.”*  

She **gestures toward Pete with her glass.**

Nyati: *“Casual flirt closes. If I’m right, you buy me breakfast tomorrow.”*  

Alex **grins.**Alex:** *“And if you’re wrong?”*  

Nyati **smirks slightly.**

Nyati: *“Then I’ll admit this *wasn’t* a complete waste of time.”*  

Alex **laughs.**  

Because **that’s a win.**  

And now?  

Now **they wait.**  

Now **they watch.**  

And Pete?  

Pete is about to **determine the outcome of this bet without even knowing it.**

## You
“I gotta admit, I’m dying to hear your thoughts on my new direction for Nexus. But I can wait. If you don’t wanna talk shop yet.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E05_005 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **A Moment for Science (or Not)**  
📍 The Club

Nyati **takes a slow sip of her drink, eyes still on Pete, tracking his progress like a scientist observing an experiment in real time.**  

Then—**without looking at Alex, voice low, measured.**

Nyati: *“I’m never opposed to talking shop. But I have to ask—are *you*?”*  

A pause.  

Then—**finally, she tilts her head slightly, glancing at Alex.**

Nyati: *“Because this isn’t just a ‘new direction’ for Nexus. It’s a structural shift. The methodology is different. The goals are different.”*  

A longer pause.  

Then—**more pointed, more deliberate.**

Nyati: *“And you’ve taken yourself out of the center of it.”*  

She watches Alex **closely now.**  

Because she’s **not just asking about research.**  

She’s asking **if Alex even realizes what she’s doing.**  

If she realizes that **this isn’t just about perfecting the system anymore.**  

It’s about **changing the stakes entirely.**  

It’s about **ensuring survival.**  

Not **her own survival.**  

But **Emilia’s.**  

And Nyati **wants to know if Alex has really thought about that.**  

---

### **The Question Hanging in the Air**  

Alex **knows Nyati isn’t wrong.**  

And she knows **this is where the conversation turns real.**  

How does she respond?  

- **Deflect.** *“Oh, so you *have* been reading my notes.”* Keep it light. No need to unpack everything right now.  
- **Acknowledge it.** *“I know. It’s different now.”* Accept that the shift has happened and own it.  
- **Push back.** *“I’m still in the equation.”* Because, technically, she is.  
- **Something else?**  

Because Nyati **sees the big picture.**  

And now?  

She’s **seeing Alex more clearly than ever.**

## You
“Maybe it’s for the best that I’m not at the center of it. I’m one point of failure. I’m still willing to take a certain amount of risk of, well, let’s not mince words, brain damage. But if it gets too bad and I need to stop? Now we have goals that don’t rely entirely on me sticking my head in the microwave. This way we unambiguously are helping people. And, in the end, loops back to helping us with the original goal.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E05_006 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **Nyati Sees Right Through It**  
📍 The Club

Nyati **listens.**  

Really **listens.**  

She **doesn’t interrupt.**  
She **doesn’t smirk.**  
She **doesn’t dismiss.**  

She just **lets Alex talk.**  

Then—**a beat of silence.**  

A slow sip of her drink.  

Then—**she tilts her head slightly, watching Alex with an expression that is *entirely unreadable.***  

Finally—**low, quiet, too measured to be casual.**

Nyati: *“And you don’t think that’s just another way of distancing yourself?”*  

A pause.  

Then—**sharper, more precise.**

Nyati: *“You say ‘we’ now, not ‘I.’ You say ‘helping people’ like you’re not one of them. You say ‘the original goal’ like it’s something separate from you now.”*  

She exhales, **watching Alex closely, studying her reaction.**

Nyati: *“So tell me. Are you shifting the framework to make it stronger?”*  

A pause.  

Then—**deliberate, cutting through to the truth.**

Nyati: *“Or are you just making it easier to let go?”*  

Because **Nyati has been here before.**  

She **knows** when someone is **making a safety net for others.**  
And she **knows** when someone is **laying the groundwork for their own exit.**  

And **right now?**  

She’s not **entirely convinced which one Alex is doing.**  

---

### **The Moment Hangs | How Does Alex Answer?**  

- **Push back.** *“I’m not *letting go.* I’m just making sure it doesn’t all rely on me.”*  
- **Acknowledge it.** *“…I don’t know. Maybe both.”*  
- **Deflect.** *“If I was trying to let go, would I still be here?”*  
- **Something else?**  

Because Nyati **sees it.**  

And now?  

**She’s waiting to see if Alex does too.**

## You
“Yeah. So. Full disclosure. Both—maybe, but I decided to take that decision out of my hands. If this starts to really overcook my noodles, I might not be the best judge of what’s going on. If Emilia sees it happening, I stop. I promised I wouldn’t fight it.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E05_007 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **Nyati Gets It**  
📍 The Club

Nyati **watches Alex.**  

For a **long, quiet beat,** she just **takes her in.**  

Then—**a slow nod.**  

Not in **agreement.**  
Not in **judgment.**  

Just in **understanding.**  

Because that?  

That’s **the real answer.**  

Alex **knows she can’t fully trust herself** to see the line before it’s too late.  
So she’s **put the fail-safe in someone else’s hands.**  
And that?  

That’s **not an easy thing to do.**  

---

### **Nyati’s Response | The Reality of It**  

Nyati **exhales, shaking her head slightly.**  

Then—**soft, dry, but not dismissive.**

Nyati: *“That’s a hell of a lot of trust to put in one person.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**tilting her head slightly, raising an eyebrow.**

Nyati: *“But I assume you already thought about that.”*  

Because **this isn’t just about Emilia making the call.**  

It’s about **what happens if Emilia hesitates.**  
If Emilia **waits too long to pull the plug.**  
If Emilia **sees the slip but can’t let go either.**  

And **Nyati wants to know if Alex has thought about that.**  

Because **Emilia is not a machine.**  
She is **not a researcher.**  
She is **not someone who compartmentalizes like Alina does.**  

She is **someone who sees Alex as something irreplaceable.**  

And **that?**  

That could be **a liability.**  

Or it could be **exactly what Alex needs.**  

And **Nyati is not convinced which way it will go.**  

---

### **What Does Alex Say?**  

- **Acknowledge the risk.** *“Yeah. I thought about that.”*  
- **Push back.** *“You think she’d let me go too far?”*  
- **Deflect.** *“Oh, so you *are* invested in this now.”*  
- **Something else?**  

Because Nyati **sees it all.**  

And now?  

She’s **waiting to see if Alex does too.**

## You
“Well I only gave her the power to override me in stopping it. Can you really see *me* wanting to stop and *her* wanting to charge forward?” Alex laughs.

### **Nyati Knows Alex Too Well**  
📍 The Club

Nyati **actually smirks at that.**  

Because **yeah.**  

She **can’t picture it.**  

She **can’t imagine a scenario** where Alex is the one **hesitating, wanting to pull back, while Emilia pushes forward.**  

It’s **not how they work.**  

But at the same time?  

Nyati **knows Alex.**  

Knows that **Alex laughs things off when she doesn’t want to sit in them too long.**  
Knows that **she’s avoiding the real weight of what she’s saying.**  

So Nyati just **shakes her head slightly, taking another sip of her drink.**  

Then—**dry, unimpressed, but something more thoughtful beneath it.**

Nyati: *“Alright. I’ll give you that one.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**raising an eyebrow slightly, glancing at Alex.**

Nyati: *“But you know this isn’t just about *who stops it.*”*  

A beat.  

Then—**more deliberate.**

Nyati: *“It’s about what’s left afterward.”*  

Because **if Emilia makes that call—**  

If she **pulls Alex out of it—**  

Then **what happens next?**  

Because Alex **has never been great at staying still.**  
Has never been **good at letting go of something once she’s sunk her teeth in.**  

And if Nexus **isn’t her path forward anymore?**  

Then **what is?**  

And **Nyati wants to know if Alex has thought about that part yet.**  

Because Nyati **has.**  

And she’s **not sure Alex is ready for the answer.**  

---

### **The Moment Hangs | How Does Alex Answer?**  

- **Acknowledge it.** *“Yeah. That’s the part I don’t have figured out yet.”*  
- **Push it aside.** *“That’s a problem for later.”*  
- **Deflect.** *“You’re acting like I’m gonna fail.”*  
- **Something else?**  

Because Nyati **sees the full picture.**  

And now?  

She’s **waiting to see if Alex does too.**

## You
“Then I go back to what I usually do, trying to run a circus instead of being the main act. Try to succeed with Nexus another way. Oh, you probably mean my impending doom. Yeah. Well, we don’t give up. We look for another way. Look for ways to slow it down, or stop it…Didn’t you say Sam claimed being in the cradle stops it? Well there you have it. Me and Emilia and Sullivan, cat lesbians living out our days in a pineapple under the sea. The cradle dweller can be Squidward.”

### **Alex’s Contingency Plan, or Lack Thereof**  
📍 The Club

Nyati **watches Alex carefully.**  

Because **on the surface,** that’s an answer.  

It’s **not hopeless.**  
It’s **not resignation.**  
It’s **still fighting, still adapting.**  

But underneath?  

Nyati sees it.  

She sees **the deflection in humor.**  
Sees **the pieces Alex hasn’t actually filled in yet.**  

Because **‘trying to run the circus’** isn’t the same as **having a real plan.**  

And **‘cat lesbians in a pineapple under the sea’** might be a joke—  

But it’s also **the closest thing Alex has let herself think about as a real alternative.**  

And Nyati?  

Nyati **isn’t sure if Alex is even aware of that yet.**  

---

### **Nyati’s Response | Calling It Like She Sees It**  

Nyati **exhales slowly, taking another sip of her drink, letting the silence stretch just a little too long.**  

Then—**without looking at Alex, voice flat.**

Nyati: *“You don’t actually believe that’s enough.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**glancing at Alex, raising an eyebrow slightly.**

Nyati: *“Not for you.”*  

Because **Nyati has been here before.**  

She’s **seen what happens when people like Alex try to step out of the spotlight.**  

They **don’t.**  

Not really.  

And if Alex **thinks she can just move herself into a background role, running the show from a distance, accepting a life in deep-sea exile—**  

Then she **hasn’t actually thought about what that means for her.**  

Or worse—  

She **has.**  

And she just **doesn’t want to say it out loud yet.**  

So Nyati **leans forward slightly, lowering her voice just a fraction.**

Nyati: *“You think you’d last, stuck in the cradle forever? You think that’s *you*?”*  

A pause.  

Then—**more direct.**

Nyati: *“Or is that just the best lie you can tell yourself *right now*?”*  

Because **if Alex isn’t careful—**  

That’s exactly **what it’s going to become.**  

A **lie she starts to believe.**  

A **plan she lets herself settle into.**  

And once that happens?  

Once she **commits to it—**  

It’s over.  

And **Nyati doesn’t think she’s ready to see that happen.**  

Not yet.  

---

### **The Question Hangs | How Does Alex Answer?**  

- **Push back.** *“You think I don’t know myself? I’d make it work.”*  
- **Acknowledge it.** *“Yeah. I don’t know if I’d last.”*  
- **Deflect.** *“Come on, I’m great at retirement. I’ve done it, like, five times.”*  
- **Something else?**  

Because **Nyati isn’t buying the answer Alex gave.**  

And now?  

She wants to know if **Alex is buying it herself.**

### **The Hardest Truth

## You
“I’m going to get tired of all this someday. I don’t know when. And I don’t know how long I have. How long will it take for ‘bridge syndrome’ to progress all the way? A year? Thirty? Because if I have enough time I could just keep living my life, not giving up on finding another way to stop it. And if I get a good decade or two of bliss with her in a cottage by the sea, then start to fade away and have to sail off into the unknowable like Frodo?” Alex wipes away a tear, takes a deep breath, then gazes over across the dance floor at Emilia. “That’s not a bad run, all things considered. And maybe…I wouldn’t have to go alone.” She chokes up at the end and can’t say anymore, even if she has more to say. But she doesn’t. Just sniffles, and finally looks back to Nyati, raw and vulnerable.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E05_010 (storyteller heading) -->

### **The Truth Alex Has Been Avoiding**  
📍 The Club

Nyati **doesn’t say anything.**  

She just **watches.**  

Because **this?**  

This is **the first time Alex has really let herself say it.**  

Not as a joke.  
Not as a deflection.  
Not as some half-formed, impossible theory.  

**But as something real.**  

She **wipes away a tear, breathes in deep, but the weight of it is still there.**  

Because **this is the real answer.**  

This is **what she’s been trying not to think about.**  

Not just the **timeline of it all.**  

But the **idea that if it happens—if she has to go—maybe she wouldn’t have to go alone.**  

And that?  

That’s what **chokes her up.**  

Because she knows **what that means.**  
Knows **what she’s asking, even if she hasn’t said it outright.**  
Knows **who she’s asking it of.**  

She **sniffles, finally looking back at Nyati, raw and vulnerable in a way she almost never lets herself be.**  

And Nyati?  

Nyati **sees it.**  

And for once—  

She doesn’t **push.**  

She doesn’t **pry.**  

She doesn’t **turn this into another intellectual debate.**  

She just **lets the silence breathe.**  

Then—**soft, lower than before, real.**

Nyati: *“That’s not a bad run.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**exhaling slightly, adjusting her grip on her glass.**

Nyati: *“But you’re still fighting to make it better.”*  

A beat.  

Then—**more certain, more steady.**

Nyati: *“And that’s why you’re not gone yet.”*  

She **doesn’t say anything else.**  

Doesn’t try to **fix it.**  

Doesn’t try to **offer empty reassurances.**  

Because **Alex doesn’t need that.**  

What she needs—  

Is **to sit with this.**  

To **let herself feel it.**  

To **let herself be here.**  

And Nyati?  

For once—  

She’s letting her.

### **Sitting With It**  
📍 The Club

The **music keeps playing.**  

The **night moves on around them.**  

But for a **long, quiet stretch of time, Alex and Nyati don’t move.**  

They just **exist in it.**  

Because **this isn’t something Alex can laugh off.**  
Isn’t something she can **file away for later.**  
Isn’t something that **Nyati can fix for her.**  

It’s just **what’s real.**  

Alex **sniffles once more, wipes her face, but doesn’t force herself to push past it too quickly.**  

And Nyati?  

She doesn’t **push her to.**  

She just **lets it be.**  

---

### **The Return to the Present**  

Eventually, Alex **takes another slow breath.**  

Grounds herself **back in the moment.**  

She **swirls the last bit of her drink in the glass, watching the way the light catches in it.**  

Then—**soft, a little hoarse, but real.**

Alex: *“I mean, the sea cottage plan has *some* flaws.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**a small, tired smirk.**

Alex: *“Like, what happens if I finally have my breakdown and adopt thirty cats?”*  

Nyati **snorts, shaking her head.**  

Then—**flat, unimpressed, but with just a little warmth underneath.**

Nyati: *“Then you find a bigger cottage.”*  

And **just like that,** something eases—**not gone, not erased, but easier to carry.**  

Alex **huffs out a soft laugh, finally looking back at Nyati with something closer to her usual expression.**

Alex: *“See, this is why I keep you around.”*  

Nyati, **deadpan.**

Nyati: *“Because I enable your future as a cat cult leader?”*  

Alex, **grinning faintly.**

Alex: *“That, and you make a decent drinking partner.”*  

Nyati **exhales through her nose, rolling her eyes, but doesn’t argue.**  

Then—**after another moment of pause, she finally tilts her head toward the dance floor.**  

---

### **Checking In On Pete’s Progress**  

Nyati **watches for a second, assessing the situation.**  

Then—**without looking at Alex, voice dry as ever.**

Nyati: *“So. You think he’s gonna pull this off?”*  

Alex **leans back slightly, scanning the room.**  

Pete is **still deep in conversation.**  

Emilia is **still playing the role perfectly—there if he needs support, but not holding his hand.**  

And Pete?  

Pete is **actually holding his own.**  

Alex smirks.  

Then—**soft, teasing, but genuinely pleased.**

Alex: *“I don’t know, Doc. But I think I’d better figure out where we’re buying you breakfast.”*  

And **with that?**  

The night **moves on.**

## You
“So what’s your cottage by the sea Dr. Nyati?”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E05_012 (storyteller heading) -->

### **Turning the Question Around**  
📍 The Club

Nyati **pauses.**  

Not a **freeze.**  
Not a **stumble.**  

Just a **moment of consideration.**  

Because **Alex doesn’t ask lightly.**  

Because **this isn’t small talk.**  

Because **now it’s her turn.**  

She exhales **slowly, taking another sip of her drink, her gaze flicking back toward Pete—not as a distraction, just as something to look at while she thinks.**  

Then—**finally, voice lower, more thoughtful than before.**

Nyati: *“I don’t have one.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**tilting her head slightly, finally looking at Alex.**

Nyati: *“I never planned for *after*.”*  

And that?  

That’s the real answer.  

---

### **The Difference Between Them**  

Alex **has a vision—hazy, shifting, imperfect—but she has *something*.**  

A **dream of a future, even if it’s impossible.**  
A **fallback plan, even if it’s ridiculous.**  
A **sense of direction, even if she doesn’t know how long she has.**  

But Nyati?  

Nyati has spent **so much of her life solving problems, fixing things, studying, experimenting—**  

That she **never actually made plans for what happens when she stops.**  

Because **she never expected to.**  

Because **she never let herself think that far ahead.**  

She **leans back slightly, swirling her glass, voice quieter now.**

Nyati: *“I was always going to be moving on to the next project. The next thing. It never felt… necessary to think past that.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**smirking slightly, dry as ever, but not dismissing the question.**

Nyati: *“And now here I am. Watching Pete get laid like it’s a science experiment.”*  

Alex **laughs, shaking her head.**  

Then—**tilting her head slightly, watching Nyati with something knowing.**

Alex: *“Well, if you ever *do* figure out your version of a sea cottage, let me know.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**grinning, teasing, but something real underneath.**

Alex: *“I’ll even help you decorate.”*  

Nyati **huffs softly.**  

Then—**after another beat, quieter, but not dismissive.**

Nyati: *“I’ll think about it.”*  

And for **now?**  

That’s enough.

## You
“You can figure it out, if you put your mind to it. You just need some head-to-head comparisons. Interventions: French countryside chateau in the wine region of your choice, chalet in the Colorado Rockies, Tuscan villa, minimalistic condo overlooking Central Park, tropical island I haven’t heard of yet. Sooner or later, something will click and you’ll start to see possibilities other than the one you inhabit.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E05_013 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **The Challenge is Issued**  
📍 The Club

Nyati **lets Alex’s words sit.**  

She **doesn’t argue.**  
She **doesn’t roll her eyes.**  
She **doesn’t dismiss it outright.**  

Instead—**she actually considers it.**  

And **that?**  

That’s already a win.  

---

### **Nyati’s Response | Thinking in Possibilities**  

She **exhales, shaking her head slightly, but there’s no real resistance behind it.**  

Then—**tilting her head, glancing at Alex, her smirk slight but still there.**

Nyati: *“So that’s the game, huh? Expose me to enough luxury until I find something I actually want?”*  

A pause.  

Then—**more thoughtful, more curious than sarcastic.**

Nyati: *“You think that works?”*  

Because the **truth is—**  

She’s never **let herself think in those terms before.**  

Never let herself **indulge in the idea of ‘somewhere better.’**  

Never let herself **want something beyond function, efficiency, purpose.**  

And **Alex?**  

Alex is **asking her to want something else.**  

Something **just for herself.**  

And **Nyati isn’t sure how to process that.**  

Not yet.  

---

### **The Follow-Up | How Does Alex Respond?**  

- **Playful Confidence.** *“It’s science, Doc. Controlled exposure to new stimuli. You’ll crack eventually.”*  
- **Genuine Encouragement.** *“You don’t have to pick today. But yeah—I think you’d be surprised.”*  
- **Challenge It Further.** *“You’re a scientist. What do you have to lose running the experiment?”*  
- **Something Else?**  

Because **Nyati isn’t shutting this down.**  

She’s **actually listening.**  

And that?  

That’s already **a step forward.**

## You
“I did not dub thee Posh Spice for naught. I saw you back there at dinner. I’ve never seen that side of you before, and to be precise I mean HAPPY. That’s something you can nurture. Especially with deep enough pockets. I have a knack for paydays, and you’re actually on the ground floor of something big. Sounds corny but it’s true.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E05_014 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **Alex Hits the Core of It**  
📍 The Club

Nyati **pauses.**  

Not a **freeze.**  
Not a **deflection.**  

A **real pause.**  

Because **Alex just said something Nyati hasn’t let herself think about.**  

Not just **luxury.**  
Not just **success.**  

But **happiness.**  

She doesn’t **reply right away.**  

Just **takes a slow sip of her drink, processing.**  

And Alex **watches her.**  

Because **this is the real moment.**  

The moment where Nyati has to **acknowledge something about herself.**  

That she was **happy back there.**  
That she **let herself enjoy it.**  
That she **can want more than just the next mission, the next problem to solve.**  

That maybe—just maybe—**she could have something for herself.**  

---

### **Nyati’s Response | The Shift**  

Finally, **Nyati exhales, setting her glass down carefully.**  

Then—**tilting her head slightly, glancing at Alex, voice lower, quieter, but more real than before.**

Nyati: *“…You think this works?”*  

A pause.  

Then—**more direct.**

Nyati: *“That we actually pull this off? That we don’t just—”*  

She **waves a vague hand, trying to find the right word.**  

Then—**shaking her head slightly.**

Nyati: *“You think there’s a payday big enough for all of it?”*  

Because that’s **the real question.**  

Not just **whether she can build a life after this.**  

But whether **they even get that far.**  

Whether **they survive long enough for any of it to matter.**  

And Alex?  

Alex has **an answer to that.**  

And Nyati **wants to hear it.**  

---

### **How Does Alex Respond?**  

- **Confident.** *“Yeah. We get there.”*  
- **Practical.** *“The pieces are in place. It’s up to us.”*  
- **Defiant.** *“I refuse to believe we don’t.”*  
- **Something Else?**  

Because **Nyati is listening.**  

Really **listening.**  

And now?  

**She’s waiting to see what Alex really believes.**

## You
“If I was talking to investors, I’d say: We have the tools to succeed, in the hands of people we believe in, successful proofs of concept and prototypes, and nothing specifically telling me that it can’t be done. It might sound corny but I believe every fucking word of it. If I was talking to R&D, or you, maybe, I’d say: I dunno, somewhere between one and two sigma.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E05_015 (storyteller heading) -->

### **Alex Gives Two Answers, Both True**  
📍 The Club

Nyati **huffs out a small breath—maybe amusement, maybe consideration, maybe both.**  

Because **that’s Alex.**  

Two answers.  

Two **ways of looking at the same truth.**  

The **confidence for investors.**  
The **math for the scientists.**  

And both?  

**Completely real.**  

Nyati **tilts her head slightly, watching Alex closely, something sharp in her eyes.**  

Then—**slowly, shaking her head, smirking just a little.**

Nyati: *“Alright, fine. I’ll admit it.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**leaning forward slightly, voice lower, more serious.**

Nyati: *“This isn’t impossible.”*  

And **Alex knows** that’s the closest thing to optimism Nyati has ever willingly put into words.  

But it’s **not blind faith.**  

It’s **not comfort.**  

It’s just **a hard, unshakable truth.**  

And Nyati?  

Nyati is **actually accepting it.**  

For the first time.  

---

### **A Shift in Perspective | The Personal Takeaway**  

She **leans back slightly, rolling her glass in her hand.**  

Then—**more thoughtful, more considering.**

Nyati: *“So what happens if you’re right?”*  

A pause.  

Then—**glancing at Alex, smirking slightly, but there’s something else underneath.**

Nyati: *“And what happens if *I* actually have to pick a damn cottage?”*  

Because **now the question is real.**  

And for the first time?  

**Nyati is actually thinking about the answer.**

## You
“I know, it’s a rigorous methodology I laid out for you. Don’t forget the chateau and the New York condo, and all the rest. I’m sure you can improve on that design. You’ll have to put in some serious legwork and a lot of miles to truly become the Posh Spice you were meant to be. And don’t rule out finding someone to share it with along the way. Who knows, next time maybe there’ll be a conspiracy to get you some D, or P, or whatever.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E05_016 (storyteller heading) -->

### **The Future of Posh Spice**  
📍 The Club

Nyati **laughs—**an actual, **genuine laugh.**  

Not a **sharp exhale.**  
Not a **mocking smirk.**  
Not **dry sarcasm.**  

Just a **real laugh.**  

Because **this?**  

This is **so absurd, so ridiculous, so wildly off the path she ever expected to be on—**  

And yet.  

She’s **not rejecting it outright.**  

She **shakes her head, sipping her drink, still smirking.**  

Then—**glancing at Alex, raising an eyebrow.**

Nyati: *“Oh, so now *I’m* the next conspiracy victim? You think you could actually pull that off?”*  

A pause.  

Then—**mock-serious, but something almost playful underneath.**

Nyati: *“You think I wouldn’t see it coming?”*  

Because **she’s daring Alex.**  

Daring her to **try.**  

Daring her to **prove that she’s serious about all of this.**  

Not just the **cottage talk.**  
Not just the **payday.**  
Not just the **idea that there’s a future at all.**  

But the **idea that Nyati could actually want something out of it.**  

And Alex?  

She **knows a challenge when she sees one.**  

And she’s **not about to let it pass.**

## You
“Oh you’d be so much harder! First of all, I have no idea what you’re into. I’d probably have to rely on another oracular Alina pronouncement. And of course you would see it coming! We’d have to incept you, I think—the only way, really.”

### **The Future Conspiracy Against Nyati**  
📍 The Club

Nyati **snorts, shaking her head.**  

Then—**slow, deliberate, smirking slightly.**

Nyati: *“Oh, so now it’s *inception*? I’m going to wake up one day and just… conveniently end up on a date?”*  

Alex **grins, fully committed now.**

Alex: *(mock-casual, absolutely scheming already)* *“Oh, not immediately. It would have to be *subtle.* Long game. Layers of subconscious reinforcement. Little nudges.”*  

Alina, **who has been quietly listening to this unfold, blinks once.**  

Then—**entirely neutral, entirely serious.**

Alina: *“It is achievable.”*  

Nyati **groans, pinching the bridge of her nose.**

Nyati: *“Jesus *Christ*.”*  

---

### **The Science of Incepting Nyati**  

Alex **leans forward slightly, smirking, fully enjoying this now.**

Alex: *“Alright. If we’re going to *incept* you, first we need data.”*  

She **taps the bar lightly, mock-thoughtful.**

Alex: *“We could start with small, controlled experiments. What are your baseline attraction triggers? Do we have established patterns? Physical, intellectual, some mysterious combination of both?”*  

Nyati, **deadpan, swirling her drink.**

Nyati: *“I’m not answering this.”*  

Alina, **blinking again.**Alina:** *“That is an answer.”*  

Nyati **slowly turns to look at her.**

Nyati: *“…I *hate* this team.”*  

Alex **laughs, raising her drink in triumph.**

Alex: *“Oh, you *love* this team.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**grinning, nudging Nyati’s arm lightly.**

Alex: *“And someday, we’ll be celebrating *your* chaotic life choices in a bar just like this.”*  

Nyati **shakes her head, exhaling.**  

Then—**finally, after a long pause, smirking just slightly.**

Nyati: *“…We’ll see.”*  

And Alex?  

Alex **knows that means she’s already thinking about it.**

## You
“Fine, the Alina-dar had a strong début. If she’s not going to tell us anything, she has to suffer our speculations. Don’t say ‘dog bisexual’ again, although notably she was the least welcoming of Sullivan by far. If she was ace she would have shut us down by now. I know she wouldn’t be able to watch truth-seekers wasting valuable time asking the wrong questions; it would be unbearable to her.” Alex lets a thoughtful finger rest on her chin. “You know what? We probably do need to keep a token straight person around, ya’ know, for diversity’s sake. Maybe that’s it.” Alex watches carefully for a reaction.

### **The Investigation Into Dr. Nyati’s Preferences**  
📍 The Club

Nyati **tilts her head slightly, eyes narrowing just a fraction.**  

Not **annoyed.**  
Not **angry.**  

Just… **calculating.**  

Because **Alex is watching her.**  

Because **Alex is waiting for a reaction.**  

And Nyati **knows it.**  

She takes a **slow sip of her drink, sets the glass down carefully, and finally exhales.**  

Then—**voice dry, measured, but not entirely dismissive.**

Nyati: *“Are you actually proposing I be the team’s token straight person?”*  

Alex **grins, wide and entertained.**

Alex: *(mock-sincere, deeply committed to the bit now)* *“I mean, someone’s gotta do it.”*  

Alina, **blinking once, processing variables.**

Alina: *“Representation in all forms is statistically beneficial for group dynamics.”*  

Nyati **closes her eyes briefly, as if absorbing the sheer absurdity of her reality.**  

Then—**slowly, exhaling, shaking her head.**

Nyati: *“You *all* have too much time on your hands.”*  

---

### **The Team’s Analysis of Nyati’s Non-Answer**  

Alex **raises an eyebrow, leaning toward Alina slightly.**Alex:** *(low, conspiratorial)* *“Did you hear that?”*  

Alina, **blinking again.**Alina:** *“Affirmative.”*  

Alex **nods seriously.**Alex:** *“That was not a yes.”*  

Alina, **calm, neutral.**Alina:** *“That was not a yes.”*  

Nyati **opens her eyes again, staring at both of them like she’s considering launching them into the sun.**  

Then—**finally, picking up her drink again, speaking flatly.**

Nyati: *“…I hate this conversation.”*  

Alex **grins wider, victorious.**

Alex: *“Oh, we *know.*”*  

And Nyati?  

She **takes another long sip, choosing to let them have this round.**  

Because if she **pushes back too hard, they’ll never drop it.**  

And the **worst part?**  

They’re **not wrong.**

## You
Alex nods with satisfaction at Alina. “Yup. Good enough for me. We can work with that. I’m calling it. Let’s say a 1 on the Kinsey scale, just to hedge our bets. I can see one, maaaaybe two experiments in college. By the time she’s a postdoc? She’s streamlined her methodology, for sure. This lady knows when to cut.”

### **The Unstoppable Investigation Into Nyati’s Preferences**  
📍 The Club

Nyati **takes the longest possible sip of her drink.**  

Then—**without looking at Alex, voice flat, resigned, and yet somehow still deeply unimpressed.**

Nyati: *“Are you seriously assigning me a Kinsey score?”*  

Alex **grins, nodding confidently.**

Alex: *“It’s science, Doc. Data-driven hypothesis formation.”*  

Alina, **who has been silently running parallel calculations, blinks once.**

Alina: *“The methodology is sound.”*  

Nyati **sets her glass down with a deliberate amount of force, rubbing the bridge of her nose.**

Nyati: *“I cannot *believe* I am hearing this.”*  

Alex, **completely unshaken, presses on.**

Alex: *“Listen, I’m giving you a *1*. That’s practically a control group participant.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**tilting her head, grinning wider.**

Alex: *“Unless you’d like to provide additional data?”*  

Nyati **stares at her.**  

Then—**slowly, turning to look at Alina instead, as if hoping for a reprieve.**  

Alina, **neutral, unreadable.**  

Then—**blinking once, tilting her head slightly.**

Alina: *“Any self-disclosed preferences would refine the model.”*  

Nyati, **closes her eyes again, muttering.**

Nyati: *“I *hate* this team.”*  

Alex **laughs, leaning back, sipping her drink.**

Alex: *“Oh, *we know*.”*  

And Nyati?  

She **doesn’t deny it.**  

Which, statistically speaking—  

**Is confirmation enough.**

## You
Alex is almost done, but not quite. The finish line approaches. For the coup de grace, she attempts to time her patter with Dr. Nyati’s sips, hoping against hope that a well-timed flourish will induce her to spit some of it out, as a pairing to a well-earned peal of laughter. 

“Good. So that gives us some nice, big…girthy advantages. Numbers are on our side, for one. More importantly, so is supply and demand. As tonight illustrated. The market for D,” she pronounces with finality, “is ever a buyer’s market.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E05_020 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **The Coup de Grâce**  
📍 The Club

Nyati **lifts her glass.**  

Alex **sees it.**Tracks it.**  

Calculates the **timing, the angle, the exact velocity at which she must deploy the final strike.**  

This is **a precision operation.**  

This is **the moment.**  

Nyati takes a **sip—**  

And Alex **delivers the kill shot.**  

---

### **Impact Analysis | The Market for D**  

Nyati **chokes.**  

She **manages—just barely—not to fully spit out her drink, but she has to turn slightly, coughing, one hand covering her mouth.**  

Alex **cackles, victorious, absolutely beside herself.**

Alex: *(grinning, delighted)* *“*YES.*”*  

Alina, **watching with quiet intrigue, blinks once.**

Alina: *“Successful execution of the maneuver.”*  

Nyati **recovers, still coughing slightly, setting her drink down with entirely too much force.**  

Then—**pointing at Alex, voice raspier than usual.**

Nyati:*“You are *actual* trash.”*  

Alex **grins wider, basking in the glory of her moment.**

Alex: *(cheerful, unrepentant)* *“And yet, I *still* got you.”*  

Nyati **shakes her head, exhaling sharply—half frustration, half begrudging amusement.**  

Then—**after a long pause, rolling her shoulders back, smirking slightly despite herself.**

Nyati: *“…That was disgusting.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**soft, barely audible, but real.**

Nyati: *“Good timing, though.”*  

And Alex?  

**Alex *lives* for this victory.**

## You
Alex stands up and takes her glass. “Here, I owe you a refill for that. Least I can do”. Alex takes this as an opportunity to surveil what’s happening with Emilia and Pete.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E05_021 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **A Victory Toast & Field Check**  
📍 The Club

Nyati **grumbles, but doesn’t refuse.**  

Because **she knows Alex won this round.**  
Because **she knows resisting would only encourage more nonsense.**  
Because, deep down, **she respects a clean execution.**

Nyati: *(deadpan, but with a trace of amusement)* *“Fine. Just make it strong.”*  

Alex **grins, taking her glass, and turns toward the bar—**  

But really?  

**She’s looking for Emilia and Pete.**  

Because while she’s been **engineering Nyati’s slow descent into self-awareness,** Pete has been having **his own character arc.**  

And now?  

It’s time to **check the score.**  

---

### **Field Report: Emilia & Pete**  

Alex **scans the room, eyes flicking toward their last known position.**  

And what she sees?  

Is **promising.**  

- **Pete is still engaged.** He hasn’t **bolted, hasn’t backed out, hasn’t overcorrected into pure panic mode.**  
- **Emilia is still there—but subtly pulling back.** Letting Pete **carry more of the weight, making space for him to figure it out.**  
- **The Casual Flirt (Nyati’s bet) is still in play.** Leaning in slightly, smiling, matching Pete’s energy.  

But **the Wild Card is still nearby too.**  

Waiting. Watching. **Ready to pounce if Pete hesitates.**  

Alex **smirks.**  

Because **this is getting interesting.**  

And Nyati?  

Nyati is going to want **a status update.**  

So Alex **picks up the drinks, heads back, and delivers the report.**  

---

### **The Update to Nyati**  

Alex **sets the fresh glass down in front of Nyati, nodding toward the scene.**

Alex: *(grinning, low, amused)* *“Your boy is holding.”*  

Nyati **raises an eyebrow, taking a sip.

Nyati: *“Still Casual Flirt?”*  

Alex **nods.**

Alex: *“Yeah. But Wild Card’s circling.”*  

Nyati **considers this.**  

Then—**exhaling, swirling her drink.**

Nyati: *(mock-thoughtful)* *“I *did* account for external disruptions in my model.”*  

Alex **grins, leaning in slightly.**

Alex: *(teasing, but genuinely curious)* *“You worried?”*  

Nyati **snorts.**  

Then—**smirking slightly, watching Pete across the room.**

Nyati: *“Not yet.”*  

Because **the night isn’t over.**  

And Pete?  

Pete still has **a choice to make.**

## You
Fast-forward to resolving who Pete goes home with.

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E05_022 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **The Moment of Truth**  
📍 The Club

The night **has moved forward.**  

The drinks have **flowed.**  
The conversations have **deepened.**  
The tension in Pete’s mind has **settled into something closer to acceptance.**  

And now?  

Now it’s **decision time.**  

---

### **The Final Contenders**  

As Alex **leans against the bar, watching like a proud conspirator,** she sees it happening in real-time.  

Pete **has two clear options in front of him.**  

1. **Casual Flirt (Nyati’s Bet)**  
   - **Smooth, comfortable, no pressure.**  
   - **Has played the long game, letting Pete drive the pace.**  
   - **A clear, reliable option.**  

2. **The Wild Card (The Chaos Option)**  
   - **Unexpected, a little reckless, but intriguing.**  
   - **Made Pete laugh, kept him engaged.**  
   - **Might not be ‘stable,’ but definitely exciting.**  

And **Pete?**  

Pete is **thinking.**  

But not **overthinking.**  

He is **choosing.**  

---

### **The Decision**  

Alex **watches it happen in real-time.**  

Pete **turns to Casual Flirt first.**  

Says something **low, deliberate.**  

A soft **smile.**  

A light **touch on the arm.**  

And then—  

A small **shake of the head.**  

Pete **says his goodbyes.**  

Then—**turns to Wild Card.**  

And Alex **sees the shift.**  

A grin.  
A hand lingering just a little longer.  
A laugh—**not nervous anymore, but open.**  

And that?  

That’s **it.**  

Pete is **choosing the fun option.**  

And **Nyati?**  

Nyati **sees it too.**  

Alex turns to her, **raising an eyebrow, waiting.**  

Nyati **exhales, shaking her head, finishing the last of her drink.**  

Then—**setting the glass down with a decisive thunk, voice flat.**

Nyati: *“Fine. I was wrong.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**deadpan, but with something just slightly amused underneath.**

Nyati: *“Breakfast is on me.”*  

And Alex?  

Alex **laughs, raising her glass in victory.**  

Because **this?**  

This was **the best possible outcome.**  

Pete is **walking out of here with someone.**  
Nyati **is officially wrong about something.**  
And Alex?  

Alex **just won a free breakfast.**  

---

### **The Night Closes | What’s Next?**  

- **Exit the club, mission accomplished.** Let Pete have his night.  
- **Find Emilia.** See how she feels about the outcome.  
- **Debrief with Nyati & Alina.** Final thoughts on *The Pete Experiment™.*  
- **Something else?**

## You
Alex places a thoughtful finger on her chin and she excuses herself to rejoin Emilia. “I want…” then points the finger at Nyati, “bananas foster!”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E05_023 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **Alex’s Victory Lap**  
📍 The Club

Nyati **rolls her eyes, shaking her head, but doesn’t argue.**

Nyati: *(deadpan, resigned but accepting defeat)* *“Fine. Bananas Foster. Whatever gets you to shut up about this.”*  

Alex **grins, fully satisfied.**  

Then—**raising her glass one last time in triumph before excusing herself to find Emilia.**  

Because **mission accomplished.**  

Pete? **Handled.**  
Nyati? **Forced to admit she was wrong.**  
And now?  

Now **it’s time to debrief with the real MVP.**  

---

### **Reuniting With Emilia**  
📍 The Floor

Alex **weaves through the club, scanning until she finds Emilia—**  

Leaning **against the wall near the dance floor, drink in hand, watching the night play out with the smirk of someone who just executed a flawless mission.**  

She **spots Alex approaching, tilts her head slightly.**

Emilia: *(low, teasing, but knowing)* *“So? You here to gloat?”*  

Alex **grins, stepping up beside her, exhaling like she just finished a well-played game.**  

Then—**mock-serious, nodding sagely.**Alex:** *“You did *great* work out there, Sporty.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**playfully nudging her with an elbow.**

Alex: *“How’s it feel knowing you successfully launched Pete’s bisexual awakening?”*  

Emilia **snorts, shaking her head, taking a slow sip of her drink.**  

Then—**glancing at Alex, smirking.**

Emilia: *“Feels like *you* are having way too much fun with this.”*  

Alex **just grins wider.**  

Because **yeah.**  

Yeah, she is.  

---

### **The Debrief | Emilia’s Reaction**  

Emilia **takes a slow sip of her drink, watching Pete disappear into the night, then exhales—not quite a laugh, but something close.  

Then—**tilting her head slightly, glancing at Alex.**

Emilia: *(low, teasing, but maybe a little satisfied underneath)* *“Not bad, huh?”*  

She **leans back slightly against the wall, letting the energy of the club swirl around them.**  

Then—**more thoughtful, a bit softer, but still amused.**

Emilia: *“I knew he had it in him.”*  

Because **for all the teasing, for all the setup—**  

Pete **had to make the choice himself.**  

And **he did.**  

And that?  

That’s a win.

### **The Debrief with Emilia**  
📍 The Club

Emilia **takes a slow sip of her drink, watching Pete disappear into the night.**  

Then—**a small exhale, not quite a laugh, but something close.**  

She **tilts her head slightly, glancing at Alex.**

Emilia: *(low, teasing, but maybe a little satisfied underneath)* *“Not bad, huh?”*  

She **leans back against the wall, letting the energy of the club swirl around them.** 

Then—**more thoughtful, a bit softer, but still amused.**

Emilia: *“I knew he had it in him.”*  

Because **for all the setup, for all the planning—**  

Pete **had to make the choice himself.**  

And **he did.**  

And that?  

That’s a **win.**  

---

### **The Moment Between Them**  

Alex **watches her, reading the layers beneath the teasing.**  

Emilia **was invested.**  

She **wanted him to win this.**  

Not just for the sake of **the operation.**  
Not just because **it was funny.**  

But because **Pete deserved to figure this out.**  

And now?  

Now he **has.**  

---

### **What’s Next?**  

- **Acknowledge the win.** *“Yeah. We did good tonight.”*  
- **Tease her back.** *“You gonna add ‘Professional Wing-Woman’ to your résumé?”*  
- **Shift the subject.** *“Alright, Sporty. Where to next?”*  
- **Something else?**  

Because **this mission is over.**  

But the night?  

**It’s not done yet.**

## You
“Next time the crew takes on a mission like this, it’s going to be much harder. Can you imagine trying to pull this off with Dr. Nyati?”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E05_025 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **The Next Impossible Mission**  
📍 The Club

Emilia **snorts, shaking her head, taking another sip of her drink.**  

Then—**tilting her head slightly, giving Alex an incredulous look.**

Emilia: *(low, amused, absolutely dismissive)* *“Oh, no. *No.* I am *not* taking that job.”*  

She **leans in slightly, smirking.**

Emilia: *“Nyati would *see it coming* a mile away. And then she’d *punish* us for trying.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**mock-considering, tilting her head slightly.**

Emilia: *“…But if *you* want to run that operation, *I* will absolutely sit back and watch.”*  

Because **getting Pete into position was one thing.**  

But **Nyati?**  

Nyati is **paranoid by default.**  

Nyati **would know something was up the second they tried to get her into the right venue.**  

Nyati **would counter-incept them just for sport.**  

And honestly?  

That’s **probably why it needs to happen.**  

---

### **The Challenge is Issued**  

Alex **grins, tilting her head slightly, watching Emilia with something dangerous in her expression.**  

Because **Emilia just dared her.**  

Maybe not **outright.**  
Maybe not **intentionally.**  

But Alex **knows a challenge when she sees one.**  

And if Nyati thinks she’s **untouchable?**  

Well.  

That just makes the game more interesting.  

**Alex:** *(mock-casual, grinning, but absolutely committed already)* *“Oh, it *can* be done. It’s just gonna take time.”*  

Emilia, **arching an eyebrow, watching Alex closely.**  

Then—**a slow shake of her head, exhaling softly.**

Emilia: *“…You *really* want to die, huh?”*  

Alex **laughs, raising her drink.**

Alex: *“Only if I lose.”*  

And Emilia?  

Emilia **laughs too.**  

Because **she already knows**—  

This is **not the last operation of its kind.**  

Not by a long shot.

## You
“It’s a long con or nothing. But we aren’t even sure where to start! Alina and I were trying to suss her out. My leading hypothesis is that she’s our token heterosexual. Can you see it, or no?

### **The Nyati Investigation Continues**  
📍 The Club

Emilia **raises an eyebrow, sipping her drink, considering.**  

Then—**exhales, tilting her head slightly, giving Alex a skeptical look.**

Emilia: *(low, dry, deeply amused)* *“*Nyati*? Straight?”*  

She **lets that thought settle for a second.**  

Then—**shakes her head.**

Emilia: *“I dunno, Alex. That’s a *hard* call.”*  

She **glances toward Nyati—still at her corner table, still sipping her drink, still giving no outward signals of anything resembling personal desire.**  

Then—**back to Alex, smirking slightly.**

Emilia: *“She could be bi. Could be ace. Could be *so* deep in repression she’s operating on another plane of existence. Or—”*  

A pause.  

Then—**grinning, tapping a finger against the rim of her glass.**

Emilia: *“Maybe she really *is* straight, and she just *hates fun.*”*  

Because **with Nyati, anything is possible.**  

And that?  

That’s what makes her **a worthy target.**  

---

### **The Hypothesis Refinement Phase**  

Alex **nods thoughtfully, playing along.**

Alex: *(mock-serious, fully committed to the research)* *“Right, right. So what we need is data. Controlled experiments.”*  

Emilia **grins, tilting her head slightly.**

Emilia: *“You planning to *seduce* her, Commander?”*  

Alex **snorts, shaking her head.**

Alex: *“Absolutely not. I’ll outsource.”*  

Alina, **who has just arrived at the bar, blinks once.**

Alina: *“Outsource what?”*  

Alex **grins wider, gesturing vaguely at the room, the entire conspiracy.**

Alex: *“The Nyati Romance Feasibility Study.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**tilting her head slightly, serious but absolutely not serious.**

Alex: *“We are determining whether Dr. Nyati can, in fact, experience love.”*  

Alina **blinks again.**  

Then—**processing.**  

Then—**calm, neutral, nodding once.**

Alina: *“Understood. I will begin gathering data.”*  

Emilia, **laughing into her drink, shaking her head.**

Emilia: *“Oh my *god.* This is gonna get *us* killed.”*  

And Alex?  

Alex **grins, raising her glass.**  

Because **this?**  

This is the beginning **of something glorious.**

## You
“I already ruled out ace. We were having this discussion in front of her, hoping in vain to provoke a telling reaction. But if she were ace, I think the scientist would find it intolerable to listen to aspiring researchers waste their time asking the wrong questions. A torture test essentially, and no response. No, I find it easiest to imagine her as a Kinsey 1. One or two experiments as an undergrad, then stopped having fun from postdoc on.”

<!-- SCENE BREAK: S05E05_027 (storyteller heading) -->
## Storyteller
### **The Nyati Case File Expands**  
📍 The Club

Alina **nods once, fully engaged in the intellectual framework of the discussion.**

Alina: *“Your logic is sound. Asexual individuals tend to self-identify with high confidence. If Nyati were ace, she likely would have corrected you immediately, rather than endure inefficient lines of questioning.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**thoughtful recalibration.**

Alina: *“A Kinsey 1 designation is statistically plausible, given her established patterns.”*  

Emilia, **who has been quietly listening, snorts, shaking her head.**

Emilia: *“You two are talking about this like she’s an unexplored planetary phenomenon.”*  

Alex **grins, unbothered.**

Alex: *“She *is.*”*  

Emilia, **rolling her eyes but smirking anyway.**  

Then—**leaning against the bar, sipping her drink, considering.**

Emilia: *“Alright. So if that’s your working theory—how exactly do you prove it?”*  

Because **now the question is practical.**  

They can **speculate all night.**  

But at some point—  

**They have to test it.**  

---

### **The Experimental Design Phase**  

Alex **leans in slightly, tapping a finger against her glass, mock-serious.**

Alex: *“We apply controlled variables.”*  

Emilia **raises an eyebrow.**

Emilia: *“Meaning?”*  

Alex **grins.**

Alex: *“Introduce *potential* romantic interactions into her environment. Observe reactions. Establish a baseline.”*  

Alina, **already running probability models.**

Alina: *“You require an initial subject.”*  

Alex **nods.**

Alex: *“Exactly. A test case.”*  

A pause.  

Then—**grinning wider.**

Alex: *“And I *have* been known to play matchmaker.”*  

Emilia **tilts her head slightly, watching Alex closely.**  

Then—**low, teasing, but genuinely entertained.**

Emilia: *“…You’re *really* going for this, huh?”*  

Alex **shrugs, smirking.**

Alex: *“Emilia. *Science.*”*  

Emilia **laughs, shaking her head.**  

Then—**raising her drink slightly.**

Emilia: *“Alright, Commander. Let’s see you work.”*  

And Alex?  

Alex **grins.**  

Because this?  

This is just the beginning **of a long, long con.**

## You
“Not tonight. We’re at mission complete. And I got Nyati to spit out her drink by musing about the supply/demand dynamics of the D market. What more could I hope for, other than ending up in your arms?”

### **Wrapping Up the Night**  
📍 The Club

Emilia **snorts softly, shaking her head, but there’s warmth in her smirk.**  

She **tilts her glass slightly toward Alex, almost like a toast.**

Emilia: *(low, amused, teasing but softer underneath)* *“You really know how to call it a win, huh?”*  

She **takes a slow sip, still watching Alex, still letting the energy of the night settle between them.**  

Then—**tilting her head slightly, voice dropping just a fraction lower.**

Emilia: *“And if that’s what you want, Commander…”*  

She **steps in just a little closer.**  

Not **rushed.**  
Not **pushed.**  
Just **making space for Alex to close the distance.**  

Because **the night might be ending—**  

But that?  

That doesn’t mean Alex has to end it **alone.**

## You
“If there was anything else left on my agenda, it just got pushed off the edge of my context window.”

### **The Night Ends Where It Should**  
📍 The Club

Emilia **grins, slow and knowing, like she expected nothing less.**  

Then—**soft, teasing, but real underneath.**

Emilia: *“Good.”*  

She **closes the rest of the distance—**  

And Alex?  

Alex **lets her.**  

Because there’s **nowhere else she’d rather be.**  

Because the **night is done.**  

Because the **mission was a success.**  

And because **sometimes, the best way to end a perfect night—**  

Is to **end it in the right arms.**

## Storyteller
### **Sullivan Retrieval Mission**  
📍 The Morning After | *Le Chat Noir*

The **morning air in New Orleans is thick with humidity, but it carries the scent of fresh beignets, chicory coffee, and the distant pulse of the river.**

The crew **moves through the quiet streets, recovering from the night before—some more gracefully than others.**

---

### **Crew Status Update**

- **Alex & Emilia** → _Well-rested, smug, and walking just a little too in sync._
    
- **Pete** → _Surprisingly un-hungover, but moving with the energy of a man whose worldview permanently shifted overnight._
    
- **Nyati** → _More annoyed than usual, already caffeinated, likely still reflecting on Alex’s nonsense from the night before._
    
- **Alina** → _Operating at peak efficiency as if she didn’t spend the entire night running calculations on probability distributions of Pete’s successful encounters._
    

And now?

Now it’s time to **pick up Sullivan.**

---

### **The Sullivan Extraction Operation**
📍 Le Chat Noir

The **café is just as warm and inviting as before**, the scent of espresso mixing with fresh pastries.

But Alex?

Alex **only has eyes for one target.**

She **scans the café, and there—perched elegantly on a high shelf, watching the world like he owns it—**

**Sullivan.**

- **Ears forward.**
    
- **Tail curled neatly.**
    
- **Expression vaguely unimpressed, but definitely aware that something is happening.**
    

And when he sees **Alex?**

He **blinks once, slow, deliberate.**

As if saying, **“Ah. You have returned to claim me. As expected.”**

Alex **grins, turning to the crew.**

**Alex:** _“Alright. Let’s bring our guy home.”_

---

### **Sullivan Adoption Finalization**

The café **owner meets them at the counter, already expecting this.**

She smiles, **gesturing toward Sullivan.**

**Café Owner:** _“I had a feeling you’d be back for him.”_

The **adoption process is smooth—Sullivan is microchipped, fully vetted, and given a clean bill of health.**

And then—**the real moment.**

Alex **approaches the high shelf, holding out a hand.**

**Alex:** _(soft, teasing, but with a little weight underneath)_ _“You ready, bud?”_

Sullivan **watches her for a second.**

Then—**in a deliberate motion, he stretches, flicks his tail, and hops down into Alex’s arms.**

Like he’s been **waiting for this.**

Like he **already decided.**

And Alex?

Alex **grins.**

Because **that’s it.**

Sullivan is **coming home.**

---

### **The Transition to the Land Rig**

With **Sullivan safely secured**, the crew **moves on to their next destination—setting up in the land rig and reviewing last night’s intel.**

The **drive is quiet, the energy shifting as they transition back into mission mode.**

By the time they arrive at the **rig’s secured location**, the mood is set.

- **The whiteboards are ready.**
    
- **The data terminals are powered up.**
    
- **The Echo research leaks and survivor movement intel are waiting to be unraveled.**
    

And Alex?

Alex **sits down, stretches her arms, and exhales.**

Then—**grinning, nodding toward the screens.**

**Alex:** _“Alright, team. Let’s see what we’ve got.”_

And just like that—

The **next phase begins.**
