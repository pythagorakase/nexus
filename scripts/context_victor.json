            "summary": "Victor Sato, once hailed inside Dynacorp as a visionary king-maker, engineered both the triumph and downfall of **Project Echo**. He approved the first unwilling upload (Dr. Alina Voss) and quietly monetized her digitized intellect. His love for his terminally ill daughter curdled into hubris when he forced Echo’s pristine protocol on her, convincing himself she’d thank him from the other side of death.\n\nWhen Alina’s model weights were stolen overnight and operative Alexander Ward framed him for a 7.2-million-scrip embezzlement, Victor was declared missing—presumed dead. In truth he slipped onto **Data Barge Okami**, carrying raw Echo data, private research funds, and a plan that could read as redemption, revenge, or both. His holographic farewell shard to Alex admits he meant to use her, begs her to “find the host” (Emilia), and hints that Echo could still reshape the world if steered by steadier hands—his hands.\n\nVictor now exists offstage as a shadow broker with motive, means, and intimate knowledge of every surviving Echo ghost. Whether he will return as ally, adversary, or tragic relic hangs over every decision the crew makes.\n\n- Born: Osaka free-economic zone; educated in MIT-Tokyo’s neuroeconomics program.\n- Career rise: From lab manager to Dynacorp Vice President of Neuro-Biotech in under a decade. Built loyalty through ruthless efficiency and strategic black-budget wins.\n    \n- **Project Echo:**\n    - Personally oversaw the prototype upload lattice.\n    - Approved **Blackout Protocol** for Alina Voss, converting her into a captive optimization engine.\n    - Tolerated the low-fidelity IQ2_XXS branch, seeing salvage value in even broken uploads.\n- **Emilia crisis:**\n    - Learned of her KADS prognosis; negotiated unlimited budget for a “perfect-host” protocol.\n    - After her refusal, forged consent documents, staged the procedure, and leaked a false childhood-death narrative to bury scrutiny.\n- **Collapse of control:**\n    - Alina’s data heist (exact perpetrator unknown to him) triggers panic.\n    - He contracts Alex Ward for Alina’s retrieval, masking true stakes.\n    - Alex’s counter-move: identity scramble, crypto theft, and framing Victor.\n    - Board purge begins; Victor flees with Echo archives to Data Barge Okami.\n    \n- **Current status:** In exile, funding independent labs, hiring mercenary info-hunters, and tracking his daughter’s movements. Publicly a dead man; practically a wildcard kingpin whose paternal love and hunger for control are indistinguishable.",
            "appearance": "Early-50s but ageless thanks to discreet med-grade nanotherapy. 170 cm, lean swimmer’s frame kept under impeccably tailored charcoal suits whose lining conceals a flex-armored exosleeve. Silver-streaked black hair swept back from a high widow’s peak, left temple threaded with an iridium neural-lace port disguised as a piece of jewellery. Eyes: dark umber augmented with retinal HUD flecks that glow amber when he overclocks. Habitually wears an antique mechanical watch with hairline cracks in the crystal—Emilia’s last birthday gift— and taps its face when lost in thought."

After surviving betrayal, assassination attempts, and corporate warfare, Alex assembles a team of outcasts and digital ghosts to destroy Echo and build something better: Nexus, a rebranded, ethical approach to digital immortality.

Choose your path:  \n\n### **1. Corpo Snake** \nYou’re a smooth-talking, backstabbing corporate asset, climbing the ladder at **Dynacorp**. Your office view is nice, but the knives in your back are sharper. One wrong step, and you’re getting “downsized” out a window.\n\n### **2. Street Jackal**\nYou’re a hustler, a cyberpunk outlaw making ends meet in the underbelly of the city. Your chrome’s black-market, your creds are dirty, and the only law is survival. The corps want you dead or indentured.\n\n### **3. Desert Ghost**\nYou grew up outside the city, a nomad in the badlands where the only rules are the ones you make.

The Snake reaches No-Name Pete’s abandoned missile-silo lab, trades the pristine Kiroshi K-512 cyberdeck, and begins decrypting the stolen BLACKOUT PROTOCOL shard.  The file proves to be a living, self-repairing neuro-algorithm that identifies itself as the digitised consciousness of Dr. Alina Voss—the very scientist the Snake was ordered to “extract.”  Working with Pete, the Snake quarantines the entity, slowly restores 43 % of its memory, learns that Dynacorp executive Victor Sato authorised her erasure, and finally relocates the Voss consciousness into a hacked Furby for portable containment.  Voss proposes an alliance: help her uncover the full scope of Project Blackout and she will become the Snake’s secret weapon inside Dynacorp.
