Just **a perch where you can see the first sparks fly.**  \n\nYou park in a **derelict parking structure** overlooking the **luxury capsule hotel** where your digital **ghost-self is supposedly holed up.** From here, you have **a clear sightline to the entrance, the security checkpoints, and—most importantly—the street.**  \n\nYour HUD runs a **passive scan.**  \n\n✔️ **Hotel security is on alert.** Extra guards at the doors, drones patrolling the balconies. **They think something’s up.**  \n✔️ **An unmarked AV (aerial vehicle) is holding position a block away.** Not a police unit. Not a normal corporate transport. **Could be an extraction team.**  \n✔️ **A Dynacorp response team just rolled up.** Black SUVs, armored, **four-man squad stepping out—tactical gear, silenced weapons.**  \n\n**You don’t stick around.**  \n\nThe moment you see **that much money moving, you know the deception worked.** Someone bought it—**or at least, they aren’t willing to take the risk that it’s fake.**  \n\nYou fire up the **Yamaha Ghost**, lean forward, and disappear into the city's veins.  \n\n---\n\n### **ANALYSIS: WHO BOUGHT THE LIE?**\n\n🟡 **If Dynacorp sent that response team,** that means they think you’re worth a **clean extraction.**  \n🟡 **If it’s a rival corp,** they’re moving in to either **grab you or kill you.**  \n🟡 **If it’s a third party,** then things are even murkier than you thought.  \n\nEither way? **They’re burning time, resources, and attention on a fake problem.** And that means **you just bought yourself a bigger head start.**  \n\n---\n\n### **FINAL MOVE: GETTING OFF THE GRID**\n\nThe city **fades in your mirrors** as you hit the **open road,** neon glow giving way to **cracked asphalt and dead highways.** The Badlands are ahead, and somewhere out there, **No-Name Pete is waiting.**  \n\nTime to see if he’s as crazy as they say.  \n\n---\n\n### **NEXT STOP: NO-NAME PETE** 🚀\n\n## You\nLet’s go!\n\n"

All unauthorized vehicles will be—\"**  \n\nYou kill the feed. **Wrong corps, wrong battlefield.** The past **lingers** out here, but you’ve got bigger problems.  \n\n---\n\n### **THE RENDEZVOUS**\n\nNo-Name Pete’s **coordinates** take you into an **abandoned missile silo**, buried deep in the desert. You follow an old **cracked service road**, headlights catching flashes of **old-world military wreckage—burned-out tanks, shredded VTOL husks, minefields that may or may not be dead.**  \n\nFinally, you hit **a chain-link gate**, reinforced with **rusted plating and solar panels.** The **sign on the fence is hand-painted, in red:**  \n\n**“NOTHING WORTH DYING FOR PAST THIS POINT.”**  \n\nYou cut the engine. The silence is **absolute.** Just the distant hum of **wind turbines** and the occasional **animal scream from somewhere too far to matter.**  \n\nThen—**movement.**  \n\nA turret **deploys from the sand**, old but **functional.** You hear **servo motors whine**, adjusting its aim **right at your head.**  \n\nThen, a **voice from the intercom:**  \n\n**\"If you're selling something, I don't want it. If you're lost, you're already dead. And if you're Corpo, you can fuck off right now.\"**  \n\nThat’s gotta be Pete.  \n\n**What’s your approach?**  \n\n1. **Go full tech-nerd.** You’ve got his cyberdeck, talk like you’re a fellow enthusiast.  \n2. **Be direct.** You have something he’ll want to see, and time is running out.  \n3. **Throw him off.** Tell him Dynacorp is already onto him—paranoia might make him listen.\n\n## You\nDoesn’t he know me? “Hey, it’s just me! You didn’t recognize me in my cool new nullcloak. I brought you a preeeeesent!” I slowly pull out the vintage deck.\n\n"
