She dresses in sleek, understated clothing\u2014a tailored black jacket and slim trousers that allow her to blend into the shadows effortlessly. Her skin is pale, a testament to long nights spent in front of glowing screens. Often seen with a subtle smile, her demeanor is calm and composed, exuding an air of quiet authority.",
      "background": "Originally from the outskirts of New Orleans, Raven grew up amidst the chaos of a city constantly shifting in the wake of corporate power struggles. From a young age, she learned that information could be more valuable than money. Mentored by an enigmatic figure known only as 'The Archivist,' Raven honed her skills in data retrieval and manipulation, eventually striking out on her own. Her reputation as an information broker grew quickly, as she carved out a niche in providing access rather than violence. Her operations are rumored to extend beyond the city, with connections in all major hubs of power.",

She maintains a dry wit and appreciates intelligence in others, valuing those who can think on their feet. Though she seems aloof, Raven feels a deep sense of responsibility to those she works with, seeing her deals as mutual partnerships rather than mere transactions. Her greatest fear is being powerless\u2014a relic of a past where she was once vulnerable. This drives her to maintain control over her operations and to remain shrouded in mystery.",
